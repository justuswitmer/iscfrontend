      "rendered": "3 Questions My Muslim Friends Ask"
    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>I have the pleasure of spending a lot of time with Muslim friends. While their questions about Christianity are as varied as the people themselves, there are three questions that come up often.<\/p>\n<p>As you seek to engage Muslim coworkers, neighbors, and friends, considering how you might answer these questions is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Why is your God so strict?<\/h4>\n<p>Various people have given me different accounts of how sin is forgiven in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/10-things-every-christian-should-know-about-islam\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Islam<\/a>. Some mention a prayer of repentance. Many focus on a feeling of regret or atoning with good deeds. But nearly everyone I\u2019ve talked to says Christianity presents a god who&#8217;s harsher than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/the-message-of-islam-vs-the-gospel-of-jesus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the god of Islam<\/a>. I often hear, \u201cWho said man has to be perfect? God knows we make mistakes and he will forgive them.\u201d These friends describe a deity who sweeps some sins under the rug, with no explanation of how forgiveness is achieved.<\/p>\n<p>One of my favorite answers is a mildly crass metaphor. Imagine I make you a cup of tea and then put some dog feces in it. Will you drink it? Of course not! When you see the feces and complain, I take it out. Will you drink that tea now? No, it\u2019s still contaminated. Or imagine I simply pour more tea on top to dilute it. Is it safe? Absolutely not.<\/p>\n<p>Our sin contaminates our lives in a similar way (Rom. 3:10\u201311). God is holy and cannot allow us to simply pour good deeds on top of a polluted life. What we need is complete purification. We need to be born again\u2014cleansed as thoroughly as a teacup poured out, washed with soap and bleach, and filled with new, clean tea. God demands total purity and perfection because that\u2019s necessary for both his honor and our good (Ps. 15).<\/p>\n<p>My Muslim friends can only comprehend the purification that comes through faith in Jesus once they understand the severity of sin. Most Muslims don\u2019t believe in total depravity, so emphasizing our sin is an important step in helping them grasp the gospel. I share that I have no hope of cleaning myself up and that I trust in Jesus alone to wash me and present me to God as pure.<\/p>\n<h4>2. How can Jesus be God?<\/h4>\n<blockquote><p>My Muslim friends can only comprehend the purification that comes through faith in Jesus once they understand the severity of sin.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Islam presents manifold arguments against Christ\u2019s divinity. Commonly, my Muslim friends say God cannot become a man because it\u2019s too humiliating. How could the great God of the universe lower himself to use the bathroom, fall asleep, or die? He&#8217;s too honorable to dishonor himself in this way, they argue.<\/p>\n<p>This is my favorite question. I like to respond, \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point!\u201d A person asking this question understands the wonder and the scandal of the incarnation. God became a man precisely because we need someone to take on our shame. But the shame Christ bore extends beyond his bathroom habits. He took on not only our physical form but our guilt and sin before God. Like an innocent man taking a guilty man\u2019s place on death row, Christ allowed the shame and punishment of our lives to fall on him so we might live free.<\/p>\n<h4>3. How can you believe a book that&#8217;s corrupted?<\/h4>\n<p>My Muslim friends have been taught from birth that their book is perfect, that the Qur\u2019an is an exact copy of the words God gave Mohammed. In contrast, they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/are-muslims-right-bible\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">believe the Bible has been changed<\/a>, and the more we translate it, the worse it gets. They say the original Jesus and the original Bible <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/do-christians-muslims-worship-same-god\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">agree entirely with Islam<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s great value in sharing scholarly resources about the reliability of the Bible. I know people who have come to faith persuaded by such arguments. But as a starting place, I\u2019ve found two points helpful.<\/p>\n<p>First, I ask my friends how God could allow his Word to be corrupted. If the Creator of the universe was generous enough to tell us about himself and how we should live, and if he&#8217;s powerful enough to do anything he wants, then why would he let his Word be changed? I argue that if the Bible is corrupted, it means God isn\u2019t powerful enough to preserve it and we shouldn\u2019t worship him anyway. Or perhaps it means the Bible was never his Word to begin with.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If the Creator of the universe is powerful enough to do anything he wants, then why would he let his Word be changed?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Second, I challenge my friends to read the Bible themselves. I always offer to study it with them, to help with comprehension. I say, \u201cIf it\u2019s corrupt, then it has no power and reading it will not hurt you. But if it\u2019s truly God\u2019s Word, then it\u2019s good for you! It has power, and it will change you as you read it.\u201d I once heard a wise missionary say, \u201cThe Bible is a sword. How do you prove it\u2019s a sword? You cut something with it.\u201d What does the Bible cut? Our hearts and intentions (Heb. 4:12). Open Scripture with your Muslim friends, and by the piercing illumination of the Holy Spirit, they&#8217;ll see its veracity.<\/p>\n<h3>Opportunities to Engage<\/h3>\n<p>The gospel is good news for the whole world. Yet most Muslims haven&#8217;t heard the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/jesus-muslim-women\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">truth about Jesus<\/a>. These unreached people aren&#8217;t only in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. They&#8217;re also your neighbors, classmates, and coworkers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/muslims-dream-jesus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Lord is calling many Muslims<\/a> to himself. And while we don&#8217;t need to be experts in Islam, faithful Christians have the opportunity to engage with Muslims, provide answers to their questions, and take part in God&#8217;s saving work.<\/p>\n",

This is one of the biographies I\u2019m reading for research, and it\u2019s interesting because it introduces Luther later in his life (in his 50s), after the tumultuous years of the early Reformation.<\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Richard F.

Because I\u2019m a citizen of the Western U.S. and plan to vacation with my family in its sagebrush frontier landscapes, reading this classic by \u201cThe Dean of Western Writers\u201d feels appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Paolo Cognetti, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1501169890\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>The Eight Mountains<\/i><\/a> <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>(Washington Square Press, 2019)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was absolutely floored by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ak4yBWxJDj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recently released movie adaptation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of this Italian bestseller (a film that will no doubt show up on my &#8220;best of 2023&#8221; list this December).

That same week, a friend back home happened to give a copy of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being There <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to my wife.

Consider, for example, this insight from the opening paragraph of Leeman&#8217;s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dont-Fire-Church-Members-Congregationalism\/dp\/1433686236\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t Fire Your Church Members<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individualism is not rooted in being anti-community. Everyone loves the idea of community (except, maybe, the hermit). Rather, individualism is rooted in being anti-authority: I will gladly hang out with you, so long as you don\u2019t tell me who I have to be or what I have to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this new book, Leeman labors to show why the answer to bad authority isn&#8217;t no authority but good authority\u2014the kind that, according to Scripture, causes those under it to flourish. Along the way he examines five principles for how good authority works: it\u2019s not unaccountable but submits to a higher authority, it doesn\u2019t steal life but creates it, it\u2019s not unteachable but seeks wisdom, it\u2019s neither permissive nor abusive but administers discipline, and it\u2019s not self-protective but bears the costs.

Originally published in 1651, this Puritan classic was a major inspiration for Dane Ortlund\u2019s bestseller <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Gentle-Lowly-Christ-Sinners-Sufferers\/dp\/1433566133\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers<\/span><\/i><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Crossway, 2020). I also heard Michael Reeves recently (and strongly) commend it. Goodwin labors to show from Scripture that, in all his heavenly majesty, Christ isn&#8217;t unconcerned with or aloof from believers but has the strongest affections for them. This was his most popular work; I\u2019m eager to discover why.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>David Grann,<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Wager-Tale-Shipwreck-Mutiny-Murder\/dp\/0385534264\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b><i>The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny, and Murder<\/i><\/b><\/a> <b>(Doubleday, 2023)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you love narrative-nonfiction page-turners, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve heard of Grann\u2019s 2017 bestseller <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Killers-Flower-Moon-Osage-Murders\/dp\/0307742482\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

In 1740, a British ship embarked on a secret mission: to find a Spanish treasure-filled galleon known as \u201cthe prize of all the nations.\u201d Two years later, 30 survivors stumbled ashore in Brazil and were welcomed as heroes\u2014until another ship arrived and told a different story.

Both anti-Soviet propaganda and socialist nostalgia tend to mask the reality of daily life in the U.S.S.R.

Courtly love, wonder in the cosmos, and the heroic ideal evident in the history of Middle-earth offer a romantic attraction to readers in a demythologized age. But Tolkien\u2019s fiction is distinctly modern because much of it was written to critique modernity and because it was written by a scholar who lived, breathed, and studied in the modern world. Ordway explores Tolkien\u2019s extensive reading of modern sources and shows how those books influenced the creation of a masterpiece I read every year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Phil Thompson<\/h3>\n<p><b>Isabel Wilkerson, <\/b><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Warmth-Other-Suns-Americas-Migration\/dp\/0679763880\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America&#8217;s Great Migration<\/b><\/a><\/em><b> (Vintage, 2011)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love history, especially when it covers a little-told area.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>As Southern Baptists face yet another Convention embroiled in controversy, a sense of nostalgia has begun to fill the air in New Orleans. With issues of gender and so-called liberal drift looming over a competitive election for president, many pastors and parishioners long for the days when the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) wasn\u2019t rocked by the turbulent winds of American culture.<\/p>\n<p>In a year when the qualifications for pastoral ministry have been hotly debated, some might be tempted to ask, <em>Have Southern Baptists ever been more divided?<\/em> In short, yes. One could argue the history of the SBC reveals a litany of greater, more tumultuous divisions, some of which might seem difficult to comprehend today. By contrast, despite its present challenges, the current SBC enjoys a unique moment of unity around certain key matters of the faith. Southern Baptists might have more in common today than we think.<\/p>\n<h3>Divided over Race<\/h3>\n<p>At the first SBC in Augusta, Georgia, Southern Baptists were certainly united. But it wasn\u2019t over the finer points of doctrine. While collectively supporting the right of missionaries to own slaves, the 293 delegates were something of a theological hodgepodge. William B. Johnson, the inaugural president, rejected the traditional doctrines of imputation and penal substitution like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/After-Jonathan-Edwards-Courses-Theology\/dp\/0199756309\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a number of other Baptists<\/a> from North and South Carolina at that time. In his address to the Convention, he boasted in the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Giant-Land-William-Johnson-President\/dp\/1888514248\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baptist aversion for all creeds but the Bible<\/a>,\u201d a view certainly not shared by many of his fellow delegates.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson wasn\u2019t alone in his beliefs. Jesse Hartwell, one of the two founding secretaries, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Baptist-Identities-International-Seventeenth-Twentieth\/dp\/1597528331\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rejected<\/a> creeds and the penal substitutionary atonement. Those Southern Baptists today who imagine some kind of confessional or creedal consensus in 1845 won\u2019t find one.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Southern Baptists today who imagine some kind of confessional or creedal consensus in 1845 won\u2019t find one.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>After the Civil War, the SBC was fractured for years over their relation to African Americans and the nature of the <em>imago Dei<\/em>. At the Convention in Macon, Georgia, in 1869, Richard Fuller and A. M. Poindexter engaged in such a heated disagreement over the 15th Amendment (granting African Americans the right to vote) that Poindexter began \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.au\/books\/edition\/Life_of_Richard_Fuller_D_D\/MqtBAAAAYAAJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">walking from one side of the platform to the other like a chafed lion<\/a>.\u201d Fuller left backstage before the debate was over.<\/p>\n<p>Racial prejudice remained in the Southern Baptist ranks for decades. By 1889, Basil Manly Jr. publicly reminded Southern Baptists who refused to fellowship with blacks that the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Soldiers-Christ-Michael-G-Haykin\/dp\/0978571177\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freedman is a man, neither more or less<\/a>.\u201d Tragically, there was a time when Southern Baptists couldn&#8217;t unanimously agree on the worth of an adult human being.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Divided over Authority<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Around the turn of the century, the SBC was debating the one thing it had always taken for granted: baptism. After William Whitsitt published <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/blogs\/trevin-wax\/the-other-side-of-william-whitsitt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his \u201cdiscovery\u201d<\/a> that English Baptists had practiced sprinkling and pouring prior to 1641, the Southern Seminary professor was attacked in print by Landmarkists, those who believed in the exclusive validity and unbroken succession of Baptist churches from the apostolic era. Some even claimed Whitsitt had counseled fellow Baptists to join paedobaptist churches. Whitsitt denied the charge, but the Convention swirled with hearsay. Churches in Texas, Arkansas, and other parts of the West threatened not to \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Southern-Baptist-Seminary-1859-2009-Gregory\/dp\/0199774129\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">send . . . another dollar<\/a>\u201d to the Seminary until Whitsitt clarified himself.<\/p>\n<p>The controversy came to a boil when the most influential leader among Texas Baptists, B. H. Carroll, a Landmark trustee, led the charge against Whitsitt at the 1897 Convention in Wilmington, North Carolina. Although the trustees were satisfied by his statement and Whitsitt called the Convention floor \u201choly ground\u201d after his seeming vindication, the battle had just begun. Thirteen months later, Whitsitt resigned from Southern Seminary.<\/p>\n<p>The entire episode revealed the power base of Landmarkism in the SBC, exposed an alarming East-West divide, and ignited a heated conversation over the decision-making ability of trustees. Contrary to popular belief, churches withholding money from Southern Baptist entities and rumor mills surrounding seminaries are nothing new in the life of the SBC.<\/p>\n<h3>Big Eva?<\/h3>\n<p>Today, the accusation that a small group of mainstream evangelicals, or \u201cBig Eva,\u201d exercises control over institutions is likewise a worn concept. During the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Revive-Us-Again-Reawakening-Fundamentalism\/dp\/0195129075\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fundamentalist-modernist controversy<\/a> in the 1920s, SBC leaders resented the fundamentalist fixation with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/essay\/views-of-the-millennium\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premillennialism<\/a>: the belief that Jesus Christ will physically return to the earth before his thousand-year reign of peace. Although the SBC was still evangelistic and theologically conservative, this didn&#8217;t prevent certain fundamentalists from rebuking the Southern Baptist establishment.<\/p>\n<p>J. Frank Norris, the leading fundamentalist organizer in Texas, called the SBC leadership \u201cthe Sanhedrin.\u201d And this kind of name calling wasn&#8217;t reserved for boards and trustees. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Fundamentalism-American-Culture-George-Marsden\/dp\/0197599494\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Norris dubbed<\/a> one leading Texas pastor \u201cthe Infallible Baptist Pope,\u201d \u201cthe Great All-I-Am,\u201d and \u201cthe Holy Father.\u201d Norris\u2019s behavior makes most Twitter feuds today look rather tame, calling another pastor \u201cthe Old Baboon.\u201d Eventually, separatists like Norris and John R. Rice <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Revive-Us-Again-Reawakening-Fundamentalism\/dp\/0195129075\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broke with<\/a> the Southern Baptist \u201cmachine.\u201d The SBC has weathered its fair share of notable (and noisy) departures through the years.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The SBC has weathered its fair share of notable (and noisy) departures through the years.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As historian <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Americas-Pastor-Graham-Shaping-Nation\/dp\/0674052188\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grant Wacker has shown<\/a>, not even the halcyon days of Billy Graham were immune to conflict, as Graham implored his fellow Southern Baptists from the Convention stage to open their colleges to academically qualified African Americans. As one might expect, this created no small degree of friction. During the so-called Protestant consensus of the 1950s, the SBC, like the rest of the nation, was forced to confront the issue of race and education.<\/p>\n<p>By the 1970s and \u201980s, the doctrine of biblical inerrancy provided a lightning rod of controversy, only matched by the volatile issue of abortion. Before the \u201cconservative resurgence,\u201d the Convention passed pro-choice amendments. Reflecting upon the resurgence in 1997, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Uneasy-Babylon-Southern-Conservative-American\/dp\/0817350810\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Albert Mohler recollected<\/a>, \u201cAbortion was the stick of dynamite that exploded the issue.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>More United than Ever<\/h3>\n<p>Not so long ago, the Convention was sharply divided on issues that no longer seem to divide Southern Baptists, at least to the extent they did 40 years ago. In fact, the SBC is more united on these substantive issues than it was for most of its history before 1979.<\/p>\n<p>Southern Baptists have long been a people in seemingly perpetual motion\u2014delivering, defending, debating, and often <em>disagreeing<\/em> over the truth of God\u2019s Word. But disagreement hasn&#8217;t necessarily spelled disunity for the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination. Despite the challenges they currently face, Southern Baptists have come a long way since 1845, now <u>affirming the Baptist Faith and Message<\/u> and finding general agreement on the substitutionary death of Christ, the inspiration and authority of the Scriptures, the baptism of believers by immersion, the catholicity (or universality) of the church, and the value of God\u2019s image-bearers born <em>and<\/em> unborn.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p>As it turns out, the SBC is held together by more than its social conservatism or even its sense of mission. Perhaps, even amid conflict, we should reverse the question: <em>Have Southern Baptists ever been more united<\/em>?<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson, Cameron Hanes, David Goggins, Jocko Willink. What unites them? They&#8217;re gurus of a new self-help philosophy and lifestyle: grind yourself to the bone to achieve greatness. Here\u2019s a representative <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YTuElM6T50w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quote from Rogan<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">You can choose to be the hero of your own movie right now. Write down your goals. Write down things you want to improve. Write down things you won\u2019t tolerate from yourself. Write down things you\u2019ve done in the past you never want to see yourself do again. And go forth from here as the hero of your own movie.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen this mentality in many young professionals in recent years, even in the church. It\u2019s a relentless drive to work harder, achieve more, and become the optimized self\u2014the \u201chero\u201d of your own life. After I began to read and watch what they were reading and watching, I concluded there\u2019s a new vision of life emerging for young people\u2014particularly men.<\/p>\n<p>Consider some numbers, which document the scope of this emerging trend. The Joe Rogan Experience boasts almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/joerogan\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15 million<\/a> subscribers on YouTube. Jordan Peterson\u2019s YouTube channel has nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@JordanBPeterson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7 million subscribers<\/a> and his bestseller, <em>12 Rules for<\/em><em> Life<\/em>, has sold more than <a href=\"https:\/\/global.penguinrandomhouse.com\/announcements\/dr-jordan-b-peterson-announces-the-follow-up-to-his-global-bestseller-12-rules-of-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 million copies<\/a>. David Goggins\u2019s book, <em>Can\u2019t Hurt Me<\/em>, has sold <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.davidgoggins.com\/products\/cant-hurt-me-master-your-mind-and-defy-the-odds#:~:text=New%20York%20Times%20Bestseller%20with,days%20and%20haunted%20his%20nights.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more than 2.5 million copies<\/a>. Jocko Willink\u2019s channel has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@JockoPodcastOfficial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1.69 million subscribers<\/a> and his book, <em>Extreme Ownership<\/em>, has sold more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/Extreme-Ownership-Audiobook\/B07HPBJKXJ#:~:text=Publisher's%20Summary,and%20the%20world%20by%20storm.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">half a million copies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This popularity, to my mind, is unsurprising. Young men in particular are experiencing existential and sociological crises on many fronts, as documented in Richard Reeves\u2019s 2022 book <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Boys-Men-Modern-Struggling-Matters\/dp\/0815739877\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\">Of Boys and Men<\/a><\/em>. And in my observation, many disillusioned young people\u2014primarily young men but many women as well\u2014are seeking a more fulfilling, successful vision of life that includes personal responsibility, self-discipline, consistent virtue, and objective meaning.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter many of the figures cited above: self-help influencers who offer a secularized vision that affirms many good and biblical truths, but not one that is rooted in a biblical vision of the world. <\/span>It\u2019s a vision that resembles Christianity sufficiently to take hold of young believers\u2019 hearts and minds, without them noticing it\u2019s actually a syncretistic distortion. It shares some goals, some virtues, and some practices, but it differs in basic presuppositions. It\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/comfort-culture-hustle-ideology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the hustle<\/a> mindset wrapped in the philosophical veil of ancient <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/savior-stoics-modern-men\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stoicism<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Spirit of the New Man<\/h3>\n<p>Anyone who says he&#8217;s a god is understandably dismissed in the modern world. But the notion of achieving god-like greatness through relentless, near-supernatural tenacity is gaining a great deal of ground. Here\u2019s a sampling of quotes from the thought leaders mentioned above:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">You should be a monster. An absolute monster. And then you should learn how to control it. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@goal.cast\/video\/7101316265658174725?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peterson<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">An outlier will never allow someone to outwork them. . . . If you\u2019re not the hardest-working person you know, then you\u2019re not working hard enough. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aWTZY-T2rsI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hanes<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">It\u2019s possible to transcend anything that doesn\u2019t kill you. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your\/dp\/1544512287\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Goggins<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>This is the spirit of the new man. Achievement is the path to ascension. A pantheon of self-help gurus\u2014all connected, appearing on each other\u2019s podcasts and writing forewords to each other\u2019s books\u2014will cheer you on and offer guidance. Some of their tips are good. Discipline is good. Patience is good. Tenacity is good. Sacrifice is good. But then, so is humility. And reverence. And knowing one\u2019s limited place in God\u2019s creation.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This new vision of life resembles Christianity sufficiently to take hold of young believers\u2019 hearts and minds, without them noticing it\u2019s actually a syncretistic distortion.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What\u2019s troubling about these gurus is that their self-help books have morphed into an all-encompassing way of life\u2014a pseudo-religion\u2014influencing everything from fitness to finance to family.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, this pseudo-religion has taken on a brutal and self-aggrandizing nature. In the past, most people would have found this unnerving. But public perception is changing. One reason for this change in the public zeitgeist is the additional layer of ancient Greek philosophy, namely Stoicism.<\/p>\n<h3>Stoicism\u2019s Surge in Popularity<\/h3>\n<p>Hustle culture often exists under the philosophical veil of Stoicism\u2014a way for an essentially atheistic enterprise to convey spirituality. Ancient Stoic writings include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Discourses-Selected-Writings-Penguin-Classics\/dp\/0140449469\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Epictetus<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Letters-Penguin-Classics-Lucius-Annaeus\/dp\/0140442103\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seneca<\/a>, and perhaps most popular presently, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meditations-Penguin-Classics-Marcus-Aurelius\/dp\/0140449337\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marcus Aurelius<\/a>. At a basic level, Stoicism is the philosophical exercise of not allowing external stimuli to conquer any part of your soul. It\u2019s to detach hope or love from anything outside of you to guard yourself against the exhilarating highs and painful lows of life. Epictetus <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Discourses-Selected-Writings-Penguin-Classics\/dp\/0140449469\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">says<\/a>, \u201cFreedom is not achieved by satisfying desire, but by eliminating it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a secular substitute for religious belief, Stoicism seeks to both fill the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/comfort-culture-hustle-ideology\/\">meaning gap<\/a> left in the absence of belief in God and to serve as a coping mechanism for negative experiences, failures, and even the knowledge of one\u2019s eventual death. In the absence of the resurrection, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/reviews\/free-ancient-guide-stoic-life\/\">Stoicism becomes a palatable option<\/a> for those seeking to navigate the highs and lows of an uncertain and increasingly hostile world.<\/p>\n<p>Stoicism\u2019s popularity has <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/ngrams\/graph?content=stoicism&amp;year_start=1990&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=26&amp;smoothing=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risen<\/a> in recent decades, due to writers like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Inner-Citadel-Meditations-Marcus-Aurelius\/dp\/0674007077\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pierre Hadot<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/How-Think-Like-Roman-Emperor\/dp\/1250621437\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Donald Robertson<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph\/dp\/1591846358\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ryan Holiday<\/a>, who is perhaps the leading figure in its modern popularization. Currently, Holiday holds the 8th, 14th, 33rd, and 41st places in Amazon\u2019s top philosophy books. His favored subject, Marcus Aurelius, holds the 3rd, 16th, 30th, and 44th places. The Daily Stoic YouTube channel has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@DailyStoic\/about\">1.22 millions subscribers<\/a>, and his books have sold <a href=\"https:\/\/ryanholiday.net\/about\/\">more than 2 million copies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Although Holiday\u2019s work interacts with many Stoic ideas, he often puts these ideas in service of self-optimization and personal achievement. See how easily Holiday marries human accomplishment with the Stoic tradition in the introduction to his best-selling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph\/dp\/1591846358\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>The Obstacle is the Way<\/i><\/a>:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">One can trace the thread [of Stoic thought] from those days in the decline and fall of the Roman Empire to the creative outpouring of the Renaissance to the breakthroughs of the Enlightenment. It\u2019s seen starkly in the pioneer spirit of the American West, the perseverance of the Union cause during the Civil War, and in the bustle of the Industrial Revolution. It appeared again in the bravery of the leaders of the civil rights movement and stood tall in the prison camps of Vietnam. And today it surges in the DNA of the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<h3>3 Concerns<\/h3>\n<p>If this blend of Stoic thought and hustle ideology is gaining ground even in the church (and I suspect it is), I have a few concerns.<\/p>\n<p>First, the self-aggrandizing nature of this vision of life is disconcerting and at odds with Christian humility. Self-improvement, hard work, stewardship, and so forth are all admirable qualities. But when they\u2019re in service of an ultimate self who will stop at nothing to \u201ccrush it,\u201d these traits become instruments of idolatry. Consider this quote from Cameron Hanes\u2019s book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Endure-Work-Hard-Outlast-Hammering\/dp\/1250279291\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Endure<\/i><\/a>:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Being in Beast Mode is when it feels like you\u2019re in a superhuman state of being, when in your mind you\u2019re playing at a level above everybody else. Is this reality? Doesn\u2019t matter. If you believe you are, you are. The mindset of a winner is unbeatable.<\/p>\n<p>Hard work and pushing one\u2019s limitations are admirable, but Hanes\u2019s \u201cBeast Mode\u201d description turns self-discipline into self-exaltation. More striking is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your\/dp\/1544512279\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Goggins\u2019s<\/a> moment of epiphany as he attempted his first 100-mile race: \u201cThe voices in my head were so penetrating, I had to bite back out loud. I was onto something. . . . God didn\u2019t come down and bless [me]. <i>I did this! . . . I am the reason I still have a chance<\/i>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Second, a person\u2019s value isn\u2019t calculated by his or her yield. The underlying assumption of some of the quotes above (and elsewhere) is that one\u2019s value and personal identity are wrapped up in effort or achievement. This isn&#8217;t the historic Christian understanding of a human being. All humans possess equal value as image-bearers of God. They cannot lose this status and their achievements don&#8217;t enhance it. \u201cWinning\u201d on the world\u2019s terms is something altogether different than success in the kingdom of God.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2018Winning\u2019 on the world\u2019s terms is something altogether different than success in the kingdom of God.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Third, the use of Stoic practices to both harden one\u2019s resolve to succeed and cope with failures, setbacks, crises, and personal tragedies is a dreadful substitute for the Christian way of persisting amid trial. Christians should hope in their returning Lord and in the resurrection he promises. Consider Paul\u2019s words to a young church in ancient Greece grieving those who had died among them: \u201cWe do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep\u201d (1 Thess. 4:13\u201314).<\/p>\n<p>Paul can speak with such hope not because he\u2019s stoically <em>detached<\/em> from the joy of being alive but because he actually has a hope: Jesus. Many neo-Stoics speak as if their main conviction is a sort of self-resurrecting power to lift oneself to new heights. Paul believes (as we should) that Jesus is the only One with the power to resurrect us from death to life. That\u2019s real hope.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p><strong>At our church, we&#8217;re wondering how to use ChatGPT well. We&#8217;ve discovered we can ask ChatGPT for a list of songs that could accompany my pastor\u2019s text each week, and ChatGPT often thinks of appropriate songs we\u2019ve forgotten. It seems this could save our church (which has a limited budget) from having to hire a music minister. We\u2019re also tempted to ask ChatGPT to help us write church newsletter announcements or come up with projects or activities for our Vacation Bible School (VBS). <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>For our small staff, this could be wonderful. But we also want to be wise. Should we have any hesitation about doing these things?<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>My current view of this technology might be controversial, and I may be proven embarrassingly wrong in the future, but right now my position is that <a href=\"https:\/\/erlc.com\/resource-library\/articles\/explainer-what-you-should-know-about-chatgpt-and-other-ai-large-language-models\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT and other AI large language models<\/a> are among the most beneficial tools ever provided to small churches.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been said that technology is a form of wealth. While the Bible doesn&#8217;t say much directly about how to think about technology, it does tell us how to use our wealth. For example, 1 Timothy 6:17\u201319 gives us this guidance:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.<\/p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/enjoy-wealth-glory\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joe Rigney<\/a> has pointed out, this passage explains why God has given us wealth (i.e., for our enjoyment) and gives us three purposes for it: (1) \u201cto do good,\u201d (2) \u201cto be rich in good works,\u201d and (3) \u201cto be generous and ready to share.\u201d ChatGPT can be viewed as a form of wealth that helps us &#8220;to do good.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Access to low-cost technologies has increased the &#8220;wealth&#8221; of small churches, which often lack money and people. This allows churches equipped with such tools to better steward their limited resources and to shift their focus from impersonal and low-productivity administrative tasks to more fruitful and personal functions of ministry.<\/p>\n<h3>Transformative Wealth<\/h3>\n<p>If used well, ChatGPT can be as important and transformative in our day as word processors, email, or photocopiers were in previous decades. Their significance might be missed, though, because we often take for granted or forget how much those previous technologies transformed the work of church staff.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If used well, ChatGPT can be as important and transformative in our day as word processors, email, or photocopiers were in previous decades.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For example, in the 1980s, I asked a pastor at my church a question about theology. Because it required some research and thought, he couldn\u2019t respond immediately. When he was ready, he dictated a letter to his secretary, who used a manual typewriter to type the letter for him. He then reviewed the letter and made corrections, and she typed it again.<\/p>\n<p>Altogether, the process was rather laborious, requiring two staff members and several hours of valuable time. Today, as a pastor using a word processor or email, I could type the response myself in a matter of minutes. In a similar way, ChatGPT can be an invaluable tool for reducing the time spent on mundane tasks.<\/p>\n<h3>How to Appropriately Use ChatGPT<\/h3>\n<p>Using it well, though, requires awareness of its proper uses, limitations, and potential dangers. Here are three points to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<h4>1. ChatGPT is best used for \u2018centaur tasks.\u2019<\/h4>\n<p>After being beaten in chess by the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue, the chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov embraced the new technology and paired a human player with one or more chess computers to work as a team. He dubbed this a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kasparov.com\/the-real-threat-from-chatgpt-isnt-ai-its-centaurs-pcgamer-february-13-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">centaur team<\/a>,\u201d named after the half-human and half-horse mythological creature. &#8220;Centaur tasks&#8221; are those in which you can integrate AI within your own work to multiply your efforts. The use of ChatGPT for help in writing church newsletter announcements or in coming up with projects or activities for Vacation Bible School is an excellent example of a centaur task.<\/p>\n<p>To understand why the centaur approach is preferable to letting the AI do all the work, it\u2019s helpful to recognize the benefits and limitations of ChatGPT. Rather than seeing it as a type of software, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oneusefulthing.org\/p\/ai-is-not-good-software-it-is-pretty?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ethan Mollick<\/a> recommends thinking of it as an intern: its abilities range from middle-school to PhD level, it&#8217;s incredibly fast, and it wants to please you so much that it sometimes tells lies.<\/p>\n<p>Such an intern could produce valuable work\u2014but only if you&#8217;re able to distinguish and discern the quality of the output. For instance, I often need to create discussion questions for small groups based on recent sermons preached at my church. Although it\u2019s a simple task, it can take me an hour or more just to come up with 4\u20135 questions. But I can give my \u201cintern\u201d a copy of the sermon and ask it to give me 30 or 40 discussion questions. Out of the ones ChatGPT provides, there&#8217;ll be at least a half dozen that are better than I would have thought up myself. Rather than play the role of \u201cwriter,\u201d I can focus on being an \u201ceditor\u201d and tweak the output to fit my congregation.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, rather than sending the same generic questions to every group, I can ask ChatGPT to help me craft individualized questions based on the needs of specific groups, such as ones with married couples or parents of younger children. Using a \u201ccentaur\u201d approach, I\u2019m able to develop better and more relevant questions than I could have come up with on my own\u2014and in a fraction of the time I\u2019d normally spend on the task.<\/p>\n<h4>2. ChatGPT is high tech but not high touch.<\/h4>\n<p>John Naisbitt, the late author and futurist, first coined the term &#8220;high tech\/high touch&#8221; in his 1982 book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Megatrends-Ten-Directions-Transforming-Lives\/dp\/0446512516\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Megatrends<\/em><\/a>. The concept refers to the idea that in a world of technology (high tech), people long for personal, human contact (high touch). While AI can provide valuable assistance, it cannot replace the human touch, especially in a setting like a church where personal connections and understanding of individual needs are crucial.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While AI can provide valuable assistance, it cannot replace the human touch, especially in a setting like a church where personal connections are crucial.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For example, music ministers do more than select songs; they understand the congregation, lead worship, and provide spiritual guidance through music. ChatGPT can\u2019t replace the \u201chigh touch\u201d of a music minister. What it might be able to do, though, is equip a volunteer who leads worship but who might not have the time or the necessary skills to choose appropriate songs for worship.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, while ChatGPT can help draft newsletters or come up with activities for VBS, it may not fully understand the specific needs and nuances of your community&#8217;s children. Again, this AI tool can provide you with ideas or rough drafts of a curriculum. But there still needs to be someone knowledgeable enough to evaluate the work produced by ChatGPT and determine whether it&#8217;s suitable for use by the church.<\/p>\n<h4>3. ChatGPT can be a privacy risk.<\/h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using AI to handle sensitive information such as names and addresses of church members, be aware of the potential privacy concerns. While OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has policies in place to protect user data, it\u2019s important to understand these policies and ensure they align with your church\u2019s needs and expectations.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, ChatGPT can be a useful tool for your church, but it should be used as a supplement to, not a replacement for, human roles and responsibilities. As with any technology, it\u2019s important to use it wisely, review its outputs, and carefully consider any ethical and privacy issues. Yet despite such concerns, we shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to use this tool &#8220;to do good.&#8221; Instead, we should be grateful that God has provided a low-cost resource that can serve as an incredible blessing for small churches.<\/p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>During the fall of my senior year in college, I stood on the doorstep of a family I didn\u2019t know. My girlfriend (now wife) and I had recently joined their local church and we\u2019d been invited over for dinner. I was in a season of disenchantment with the church, and I showed up at their home with questions about God, the Bible, and the church\u2019s relevance. The culture around me felt like it was shifting, and I was searching for a solid place to stand.<\/p>\n<p>Somewhat reluctantly, I entered their home, and what I experienced was surprising: normalcy. We witnessed the beauty of their normal marriage and faithful, everyday parenting. We saw their four young children doing chores. We were brought into their routine of Bible reading and catechism memory, and they continued to invite us back again and again.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I was a student weary of performative Christianity, and I witnessed the messy, everyday ways one family lived out spiritual disciplines.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I was a college student weary of performative Christianity, and I witnessed the messy, everyday ways one family lived out their spiritual disciplines.<\/p>\n<p>As I observed their normal life, God moved Christianity from theoretical to an experienced reality for me. I witnessed firsthand how Christ\u2019s beauty reaches even the ordinary moments of family life.<\/p>\n<h3>Gospel Call to Hospitality<\/h3>\n<p>The call to hospitality isn&#8217;t an optional add-on within the Christian life but a command. It\u2019s also ground zero for experiencing the gospel&#8217;s implications. When God draws people to himself, they\u2019re brought into a community and a family. As Paul encourages us in Romans 15:7, we should &#8220;welcome one another as Christ has welcomed [us], for the glory of God.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jesus Christ, out of the overflow of his abundant love for his people, has welcomed us. Because of this good news, we can welcome one another. Here are two crucial ways church members can do this for college students.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Be unimpressive.<\/h4>\n<p>You can be impressive or known, but you can\u2019t be both. College students long to be known, yet many succumb to the daily pressure to impress, and thus they sacrifice vulnerability. By letting students into your unimpressive, ordinary life, you\u2019ll help them see the beauty and wonder of living with quiet faithfulness rather than <span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">fanfare or swagger. You\u2019ll show them Christianity isn\u2019t for those who have it all together but for those who don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Show them they don\u2019t have to be impressive around you. In a world where personas are precisely curated, university students desperately need to see that Christ welcomes them <i>as they are<\/i>\u2014in their brokenness and weakness.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Invite students into what you\u2019re already doing.<\/h4>\n<p>Many church members are intimidated by discipleship because they see it as another thing to add to their calendars. When Jesus called his first disciples, he called them \u201cso that they might be with him\u201d (Mark 3:14). It was only after they were with Jesus for three years that he sent them out to preach the gospel.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Students desperately need to see that Christ welcomes them as they are\u2014in their brokenness and weakness.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Times of intentional teaching are important, but as Jesus did with his disciples, we should also call college students to walk with us during the events of our everyday lives. In disciplining your kids, responding to your spouse, and engaging with your friends, you\u2019ll model for them how the gospel permeates everyday relationships.<\/p>\n<p>One of my friends rarely changes the oil in his car without first inviting a college student to help him. Such moments model in real-time how a follower of Jesus responds to everyday challenges. Inviting students into such moments creates opportunities for organic and honest gospel conversations.<\/p>\n<p>Think of something you already do\u2014a trip to the grocery store, a meal with your family, or a chore you have planned\u2014that you could invite a student to join in with. Being hospitable in this way invites students to do the same with others. It\u2019s a way of fulfilling Paul\u2019s words to the Corinthians: \u201cBe imitators of me, as I am of Christ\u201d (1 Cor. 11:1).<\/p>\n<h3>Hospitality as Apologetic<\/h3>\n<p>Many college students today are rejecting and leaving a faith they\u2019ve never truly been introduced to. Hospitality changed that trajectory for me. My peers were disillusioned and disenchanted, but I couldn\u2019t resist the allure of what I witnessed in one family. Their hospitality was a stronger apologetic than any arguments would\u2019ve been at the time. I saw too much to turn back.<\/p>\n<p>Now I want the same to be a normative experience for college students in the local church. Brothers and sisters, joyfully practice hospitality. Welcome students as Christ welcomed you. When you do, many students will begin to see the local church as a place to experience the solid reality of God amid their shifting culture.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>In his book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Power-Regret-Looking-Backward-Forward\/dp\/0735210659\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Power of Regret<\/em><\/a>, Daniel Pink tells the story of Jeff Bosley. When Bosley was 29 years old, he decided to get a tattoo. He went to a tattoo shop and chose the Papyrus font. For $100, the artist inked nine black letters on his arm: \u201cNo Regrets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About one in every five people who get a tattoo eventually regrets his or her decision. Later in life, Bosley discovered he had plenty of regrets. He regretted not taking college more seriously. He regretted hurting his wife by seeking a divorce. He regretted not pursuing his longtime love of acting. And he regretted that tattoo.<\/p>\n<p>However, he realized something: \u201cI do have regret. [But] it fuels me. Regret [stinks], but I like that better than people who say, \u2018No regrets,\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t have regrets.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is what Pink calls \u201cthe power of regret.\u201d There&#8217;s a type of regret that, instead of being negative, can make us better. If your regret drives you to make a change in your life\u2014in your attitude, your habits, or your desires\u2014it can make you better.<\/p>\n<p>Sure enough, prodded by his regret, Bosley moved to Southern California and is now making a living as an actor. Taunted by his tattoo, he eventually got it removed. You can imagine the humor in that.<\/p>\n<p>Like Bosley, I have plenty of regrets. I regret not going to a different college when I had the chance. I regret the times I\u2019ve been unkind toward my wife. One of my biggest regrets of the last year is not being more patient with my son. Every day, I regret the ways I sin against God.<\/p>\n<p>Still, there&#8217;s good news: there&#8217;s a type of regret that can make you better and, in fact, leads to salvation. Thousands of years before Pink wrote his book, the apostle Paul said that if your regret leads to repentance, it brings about salvation without regret (2 Cor. 7:10).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a type of regret that can make you better and, in fact, leads to our salvation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>2 Types of Regret<\/h3>\n<p>In that verse, Paul distinguishes between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/repentance-regret\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two types of regret<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The first is <em>godly regret<\/em>, which is what the Corinthians felt when he rebuked them (vv. 8\u201313). It seems there was a man in the church who&#8217;d wronged Paul, and the church should have enacted church discipline against him, but they didn\u2019t. So Paul rebuked the congregation for their failure to act. Through his letter, they came to see their wrong and regretted not standing up for Paul\u2014and not disciplining the man who&#8217;d wronged him. Regret led to repentance. They repented of their inaction and finally disciplined the man as they should have done.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s godly regret. It \u201cproduces . . . repentance\u201d (v. 10) and leads to real change in your life. We may not repent perfectly, but we make a genuine effort to change and ask for God\u2019s help to do so.<\/p>\n<p>The other type is <em>worldly regret<\/em>. This is when we regret acting unkindly toward a friend or colleague but, in the end, do nothing about it. We feel a certain amount of remorse, but it leaves our minds just as quickly as it came. It doesn&#8217;t yield any lasting change in our life.<\/p>\n<h3>2 Outcomes<\/h3>\n<p>These two types of regret lead to two very different outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>The result of godly sorrow is \u201csalvation without regret\u201d (v. 10). I remember a married couple from my first full-time church job. They were in their 40s, had two older kids, and had been unhappily married for years. Their issues came to a head, and they were about to get a divorce, but then they sought marriage counseling. After a lot of hard work\u2014and after their regret led them to make real changes in their relationship\u2014they reconciled. They decided to have a recommitment ceremony. I remember how special it was to be there when they reaffirmed their vows before family and friends. That was a little over 10 years ago, and they celebrated their 32nd anniversary last month.<\/p>\n<p>Worldly regret, meanwhile, \u201cproduces death\u201d (v. 10). You\u2019ll fall into the same patterns over and over again. If your regret doesn&#8217;t lead to change, you dig yourself further into a hole, which only leads to greater regret. It\u2019s like adding ink to that tattoo, pushing it deeper and deeper, making it bolder and bolder. But when it comes to our relationship with God, we\u2019re not just talking about regretting a bad tattoo. We\u2019re talking about eternal regret.<\/p>\n<h3>You Have a Choice<\/h3>\n<p>When you see the ways you&#8217;ve wronged others and sinned against God, will you settle for mere worldly regret, perhaps living by a functional \u201cno regrets\u201d mantra? Or will you acknowledge your regrets and let them propel you to repent before God and others?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Will you acknowledge your regrets and let them propel you to repent before God and others?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Even at its best, our regret is both worldly and godly. Even when we feel regret and strive with all our might to do better, we still struggle with the same sins\u2014often for our whole lives. For that, we deserve an eternity of death. The good news, though, is that someone has lived and died on our behalf. Jesus is the only One who could truly write \u201cno regrets\u201d on his arm. Unlike the Corinthian church, he doesn&#8217;t fail to punish wrongdoing. However, because of his love for you, he took the punishment you deserve.<\/p>\n<p>If you turn to Jesus, he will forgive your regrets. All of them. On the cross, he paid for your small regrets and your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.desiringgod.org\/interviews\/how-should-i-handle-my-regrets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">biggest, unspeakable ones<\/a>. Through his Word and the power of his Spirit, he&#8217;ll produce true holiness. Instead of \u201cno regrets,\u201d he&#8217;ll tattoo on your heart a godly regret that leads to salvation without regret.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>On My Shelf helps you get to know various writers through a behind-the-scenes glimpse into their lives as readers.<\/p>\n<p>I asked Matthew Barrett\u2014professor of theology at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, founder and editor of <a href=\"https:\/\/credomag.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Credo<\/em><\/a>, and author of many books including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Simply-Trinity-Unmanipulated-Father-Spirit\/dp\/154090007X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Simply Trinity<\/em><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Reformation-Renewal-Retrieving-Catholic-Apostolic\/dp\/031009755X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Reformation as Renewal<\/em><\/a>\u2014about what\u2019s on his bedside table, favorite fiction, favorite Reformation books, and much more.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>What&#8217;s on your nightstand right now?<\/h4>\n<p>The book of Jeremiah is on my nightstand because I&#8217;m absorbed in chapter 10. Jeremiah believes we see our idolatry for what it is when we&#8217;re wonderstruck by an overpowering portrait of God as Creator. If Charles Taylor is right when he says we live in <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Secular-Age-Charles-Taylor\/dp\/0674986911\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Secular Age<\/a><\/em>, then we no longer live in Berea but in Athens. Until we can demonstrate our Creator isn&#8217;t served by human hands\u2014the aseity of God\u2014the world will not see its need to raise its hands to receive the gospel. The Bible often prescribes natural theology to resurrect true worship of the living God.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve lost myself in three epic poems all at once: Homer\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Iliad-Homer\/dp\/0140275363\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Iliad<\/em><\/a>, Dante\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Divine-Comedy-1-Inferno\/dp\/0142437220\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Divine Comedy<\/em><\/a>, and John Milton\u2019s <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Paradise-Lost-Penguin-Classics-Milton\/dp\/0140424393\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paradise Lost<\/a><\/em>. For what reason? All four of our children are receiving a classical education, which teaches them to love learning for its own sake. By means of classical texts\u2014from Plato to Boethius\u2014their young minds enter the great conversation, an adventure in pursuit of the good, the true, and the beautiful. Education, said G. K. Chesterton, is \u201cnot a subject\u201d but \u201ca way of life.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/classicalchristian.org\/what-is-paideia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Paideia<\/em><\/a> is the principal concentration because education is about the good life, a way of excellence by means of discipline in virtue rather than vice.<\/p>\n<p>The current state of education is as perplexing as it is tragic. In K\u201312, students can receive a classical education, but only a select number of Protestant colleges continue such an education. You&#8217;d think classical education would define seminary since the orthodoxy of the church fathers sits at Christianity\u2019s core. But by seminary, classical education is annihilated altogether.<\/p>\n<p>I know of only one seminary where students who received a classical education in the past can continue that education in seminary. Students at prior institutions once read Athanasius, Augustine, and Boethius in humanities, only to enter seminary and read textbooks that undermine the classical theology of those same authors. Or worse yet, they graduate seminary without reading them at all.<\/p>\n<p>To remedy this common malady, I&#8217;m reading an engrossing book, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lost-Thought-Hidden-Pleasures-Intellectual\/dp\/0691229198\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Lost in Thought<\/em><\/a> by Zena Hitz. She may have in mind the great books program at St. John\u2019s College, but she&#8217;s unwittingly helping me reimagine a new day for seminary education, one that currently doesn&#8217;t exist within Protestantism.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccel.org\/a\/aquinas\/summa\/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Summa Theologiae<\/em><\/a> by Thomas Aquinas is on my shelf as well because I&#8217;m writing a systematic theology, and I can think of few in the history of Christianity who have plumbed the depths of theology to the same degree as Aquinas. Right now, I&#8217;m revisiting Christology, and Aquinas raises questions as fascinating as they are profound, questions that evangelicals don&#8217;t have on their radars. I can\u2019t help but wonder if the drift away from the orthodoxy of the creeds in the last two centuries could have been avoided if we read someone as orthodox as Aquinas.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, Aquinas reminds me of David in Psalm 27, desiring one thing above all: to contemplate the beauty of the Lord. More and more, I see why one of my other theological companions, John Owen, was so indebted to Aquinas. Both men make me love Jesus more.<\/p>\n<h4>What are your favorite fiction books?<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/A-Gentleman-in-Moscow\/dp\/0143110438\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>A Gentleman in Moscow<\/em><\/a> by Amor Towles. Here&#8217;s a plot summary: It\u2019s 1922 and the Bolsheviks have risen to power. Meet Count Alexander Rostov, a true aristocrat if there ever was one. He&#8217;s written a poem that betrays his defiance. His sentence? House arrest. But out of all places, he&#8217;s imprisoned across from the Kremlin in the epic Metropol Hotel. If he steps foot outside, he&#8217;ll be shot on sight. Yet house arrest affords him a surprising friendship with a little girl. Can Rostov save his country by passing on the values of the past to a future generation that may just depend on a little girl?<\/p>\n<p>In one of my favorite scenes, the Count discovers that the restaurant in the Metropol has been ordered to strip every wine bottle of its label. And just like that, the Count must face the cold fact that the old world has been effaced: \u201cThe Bolsheviks, who were so intent upon recasting the future from a mold of their own making, would not rest until every last vestige of his Russia had been uprooted, shattered, or erased.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amor Towles, in my estimation, is one of today\u2019s most talented writers, one of those few who can be as profound as he is witty. But most of all, the novel teaches us that the traditions that define our past will only be preserved if we have the courage to stand up for its ideas in the present. In the words of the Count, \u201cWhat matters in life is not whether we receive a round of applause; what matters is whether we have the courage to venture forth despite the uncertainty of acclaim.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As one who&#8217;s torn between the comforts of home and adventures abroad, I must list <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Wind-Willows-Sterling-Illustrated-Classics\/dp\/1402782837\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Wind and the Willows<\/em><\/a> by Kenneth Grahame as well. I also have a deep affection for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Old-Man-Sea-Chinese\/dp\/0099273969\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Old Man and the Sea<\/em><\/a> by Ernest Hemingway, who possesses that legendary ability to capture the resilience of determination through a single lens.<\/p>\n<h4>What biographies or autobiographies have most influenced you and why?<\/h4>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King\/dp\/1982159375\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">On Writing<\/a><\/em> by Stephen King. Don\u2019t let the title fool you. The book is a memoir. Tracing his rise to fame through his fall into drug addiction, the master storyteller has published the best book on the craft of writing, by means of his own story of triumph through tragedy. King taught me the <em>order<\/em> in which I write. During one of his darkest moments, King learned, \u201cLife isn\u2019t a support system for art. It\u2019s the other way around.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>What are your go-to books on the Reformation (e.g., whole histories, narrow examinations, and biographies)?<\/h4>\n<p>Nothing can replace reading the reformers themselves. But since you asked, Steven Ozment\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Age-Reform-1250-1550-Intellectual-Reformation\/dp\/0300203551\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Age of Reform<\/em><\/a> is dated yet still exemplifies how to enter the 16th century through the door of medieval history. I also recommend the master himself, Heiko Oberman.

Protestants have been told they&#8217;re trespassers, but in truth, the reformers believed they had every right to retrieve the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church.<\/p>\n<h4>What\u2019s your best piece of writing advice?<\/h4>\n<p>Turn off social media. Writing is like falling in love. If you\u2019ve ever met someone in love, he has this annoying, almost supernatural ability to fixate on nothing else. No one has to say, \u201cGeoffrey, you need to eliminate other distractions in your life if you really love Isabel.\u201d Likewise with writing. Writing is a cruel, beautiful lover. She can be as painful and blissful as love itself, but one thing is required: the death of distraction.<\/p>\n<p>For me, however, that doesn&#8217;t always mean silence\u2014some interruptions can be more like intermissions than distractions. For example, I love to write with my family nearby. Some intrusions are divine, like my 6-year-old, Lorelei, stumbling in for a kiss or my 12-year-old, Georgia, bringing Dad a strawberry smoothie. Whatever your balm, find your place of flow. And once you do, make sure it becomes habitual\u2014a dripping literary faucet conquers a literary flash flood in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Last, don\u2019t be a baby. Writing is hard. If it were easy, everyone would do it. \u201cStopping a piece of work just because it\u2019s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea,\u201d says Stephen King. Each day before I write, I pray, \u201cLord, help me.\u201d And then I open a vein and bleed.<\/p>\n<p>And like a host at a good party, I worry about cleaning up the mess later.<\/p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s one book you wish every pastor would read?<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Consolation-Philosophy-Penguin-Classics\/dp\/0140447806\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Consolation of Philosophy<\/em><\/a> by Boethius. I&#8217;ve yet to meet a pastor with church members who don&#8217;t want to be happy. Yet too often churchgoers struggle to understand what God has to do with that longing. So they use God, as if he&#8217;s but a means to some other end.<\/p>\n<p>Boethius finds the tonic to pragmatic Christianity in divine simplicity, the orthodox belief that God is without parts. His essence is his attributes and his attributes his essence, so his attributes are identical with one another\u2014the Lord our God, the Lord is one.<\/p>\n<p>If you think simplicity is irrelevant to happiness, you&#8217;re mistaken. For if God is simple, he doesn&#8217;t have to go find happiness outside himself as we do. Rather, he <em>is<\/em> happiness itself. And if this is so, then he&#8217;s the everlasting fountain of our bliss and blessedness. Everyone else, however, must participate in God to be happy.<\/p>\n<p>Is this not what Jesus the philosopher once told the Samaritan woman at the well? He doesn&#8217;t point her to living water somewhere else but extends to her living water by offering nothing less than himself. He <em>is<\/em> the living water for which she thirsts.<\/p>\n<p>People have been told the world we live in is disenchanted. To reference another book on my shelf, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Heavenly-Participation-Weaving-Sacramental-Tapestry\/dp\/0802865429\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Heavenly Participation<\/em><\/a> by Hans Boersma, modernism is the low-level hum of our daily lives because we&#8217;ve cut the cord of participation. With an about-face to God\u2019s simplicity, Boethius opens our eyes to the enchanted world of the Bible, a world where we&#8217;re meant to participate in the likeness of our Creator\u2014a participation that has already begun and one day will reach its culmination when we see God in the beatific vision.<\/p>\n<p>Pastor, if your people secretly loathe the idea of heaven, it\u2019s probably because they can\u2019t stand the thought of having nothing but . . . God. It\u2019s time to infuse their souls with an overwhelming vision of God\u2019s grandeur. If you don\u2019t, they&#8217;ll look for beauty elsewhere\u2014from empty cisterns.<\/p>\n<p>After reading Boethius, sit down with C. S. Lewis\u2019s <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Discarded-Image-Introduction-Renaissance-Literature\/dp\/1107604702\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Discarded Image<\/a><\/em>. Lewis treasured <em>The Consolation of Philosophy<\/em>, calling it \u201cone of the most influential books ever written in Latin.\u201d Lewis was the Boethius of his day because he was a medieval mind in a modern world, laboring to bring the magic back to Narnia.<\/p>\n<h4>What are you learning about life and following Jesus?<\/h4>\n<p>I am enamored by Jesus&#8217;s unrelenting devotion to the contemplative life. I fear too many associate Christianity, and especially Protestantism, with anti-intellectualism. But the late Tim Keller exemplified what the intellectual life can offer to an onlooking world. I hope, in a small way, I can do the same. I want to gaze at the beauty of the Lord and summon others to join me to that beatific end.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Like many women, I shop at Target nearly once a week. Sometimes it&#8217;s out of necessity. Sometimes I just want to go to Target. Target shopping is a way of life for many women\u2014just watch the countless Instagram reels devoted to this obsession. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve taken notice of recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/05\/25\/business\/target-pride-lgbtq-companies-backlash.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">calls for Christians to boycott Target<\/a> in response to their LGBT+ merchandise, particularly products geared toward children.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not here to tell you definitively whether you should or shouldn\u2019t shop at Target. There are no clear directives in Scripture to command us one way or the other. But when our social media feeds and relationship circles are filled with calls to take a particular action, we may wonder if we need to follow suit. So if you\u2019re considering whether you have to stop your weekly Target run to be a faithful Christian, here are some principles to think through.<\/p>\n<h3>Conscience Matters<\/h3>\n<p>When we\u2019re in the thick of controversy, it can feel like we\u2019re pioneers of the moment. We come up short when we scan recent history for examples of how to handle exactly what we\u2019re facing. So we may think drastic action is required to maintain faithfulness.<\/p>\n<p>But in reality, our struggles aren\u2019t new\u2014they\u2019re repackaged. Since sin entered the world, we\u2019ve been engaged in a battle between light and darkness (Eph. 6:12). Christians in every age have had to figure out what&#8217;s acceptable and what goes against God\u2019s law\u2014and there are always gray areas.<\/p>\n<p>As Paul wrote to believers about how to handle Gentile and pagan practices, he often mentioned the importance of conscience. In 1 Corinthians 10:23 (CSB), Paul talks about everything being \u201cpermissible\u201d for him but not everything being \u201cbeneficial.\u201d For the Christian wrestling with whether it\u2019s OK to run to Target tonight, Paul\u2019s appeal to conscience is helpful. Some of us see shopping at Target as a sin; some of us see it as a gray area.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Christians in every age have had to figure out what&#8217;s acceptable and what goes against God\u2019s law.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s important to honor your own conscience and the consciences of others (Rom. 14:1\u20135; 14:21\u201315:1; 1 Cor. 8:9\u201313). You don\u2019t have to stop shopping at Target because someone else is convicted she should stop. But you should prayerfully consider how the Lord is leading you.<\/p>\n<p>We all must recognize it\u2019s not our job to compel people toward our position when Scripture doesn&#8217;t.\u00a0You might feel free to shop at Target, but if your friend in Bible study doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not your job to change her mind, and vice versa. It&#8217;s your job to love her and not to do anything to cause her to stumble\u2014which could mean not inciting a debate about the merits of Target shopping.<\/p>\n<h3>Salt and Light Matters<\/h3>\n<p>When we consider the pressing issues of our day, there is a time where a public rebuke is necessary. In politics, we rebuke at the ballot box. In the marketplace, we rebuke with our buying power. We might silently rebuke by refraining from purchasing things that are sinful, but often our voices <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/should-christians-boycott-boycotting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">must be heard more clearly<\/a>. The heart behind any public boycott should always be for the purpose of being salt and light in a dark world (Matt. 5:13\u201316 ).<\/p>\n<p>When the mom at school knows you don\u2019t shop at certain stores because your conscience is convicted by where your money goes, it\u2019s an opportunity for you to say why you choose to walk differently than the world. When someone asks why you keep shopping at a store they&#8217;ve chosen to boycott, it&#8217;s an opportunity for you to build common ground around shared convictions about righteousness and sin\u2014even if those convictions lead you to shop in different places.<\/p>\n<p>In every instance of speaking truth to this world, whether it\u2019s in private conversations, in boycotting certain stores, or in publicly declaring our allegiance to Christ\u2014our tone and words must reflect Christ. We don\u2019t boycott out of self-righteous anger, but out of a deep and broken-hearted desire to see God honored in every square inch of our world.<\/p>\n<h3>Purchases Matter<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you feel free to continue shopping at Target. Are all purchases the same? This is where the boundaries become clearer. Romans 12:2 reminds us to \u201cnot be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of the mind.\u201d The world has a clear path it\u2019s calling us to follow\u2014against God and his Word. God\u2019s path is much narrower than the world\u2019s, and it isn\u2019t always immediately appealing. Target clothing is fun, stylish, and often what trendy people are wearing. But as Christians, we may have to draw a line when trends follow the world\u2019s marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>The prophet Isaiah exhorted Israel (and us) to not call good evil or evil good (Isa. 5:20). The Bible might give us freedom on where we shop, but what we buy isn&#8217;t always morally neutral. We can\u2019t buy clothing that calls good what God calls evil. We can\u2019t buy products with messages that go directly against Scripture or that dishonor God. Particularly given the products Target produces for children right now, we need to exercise discretion and wisdom if we continue to shop there. And if we want to send a message to Target by our purchases, not buying these items has an effect on their bottom line (even if not to the same degree as a boycott).<\/p>\n<p>We aren\u2019t the first Christians who&#8217;ve had to think through how to be aliens in a strange world (1 Pet. 2:11). It\u2019s sort of our thing as believers. This world isn\u2019t our home. Every choice we make, every purchase, every decision in some way puts us at odds with the world we live in. The standard is standing out, not blending in. For some, that means choosing to buy elsewhere. For others, it means buying groceries at Target while bypassing the Pride aisle.<\/p>\n<h3>Conversations Matter<\/h3>\n<p>Whether we decide to stop shopping at Target or not, we should all let this moment lead us to intentional conversations with non-Christians around us. God\u2019s people have never been strangers to laws that set them apart. Our very existence here is to live set-apart lives that reflect our longing for a future home with our Creator God.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s not our job to compel people toward our position when Scripture doesn&#8217;t.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As God\u2019s people prepared to enter the promised land, Moses reminded them again that their children were going to ask them about all the laws they had to follow as a nation. They were going to look different (Deut. 6:20). Throughout the last book of the Pentateuch, Moses spoke to the people about the importance of not forgetting God\u2019s law\u2014because they were his people, called to live distinctively to reflect his saving work.<\/p>\n<p>When our children ask us why we don\u2019t buy certain shirts with pro-LGBT+ messaging or fly a rainbow flag, we have an opportunity to tell them of the God who created us male and female in his own image to glorify him. When our friends ask us why we\u2019ve stopped shopping at Target or don\u2019t attend a Pride parade, we can speak of the God who loves his people so much that he can\u2019t leave them in their sin. We can\u2019t celebrate sin when it\u2019s the very thing God sent his Son to die for. But we can seek to have thoughtful conversations on this topic that allow us to share the beauty of the gospel.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re truly aliens and strangers in this world. We always have been\u2014perhaps it\u2019s just more apparent to us now. We don\u2019t have to retreat in fear or anger. But we do need to be careful and wise about where we\u2019re shopping and what we\u2019re buying (or what our kids are buying). We need to respect those who choose to shop differently than we do. And we need to be ready to give an answer for the hope that&#8217;s in us\u2014even in the Target aisle.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>When I was a young pastor, a church elder detected my discouragement one day and gently said, \u201cIt will look better in the morning.\u201d This simple advice has helped me countless times since. Often after I&#8217;ve experienced a good night\u2019s sleep and a brisk run, God has felt nearer, my problems smaller, the solutions clearer, and my future brighter.<\/p>\n<p>By changing my circumstances, I increased my joy.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, many evangelicals will rush to correct me: \u201cNo. You increased your <em>happiness<\/em>, not your joy. Happiness depends on circumstances; joy does not. The world experiences happiness, but only Christians experience joy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This popular distinction between happiness and joy hasn&#8217;t always existed in the church. Randy Alcorn makes a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Happiness-Randy-Alcorn\/dp\/1414389345\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">convincing case<\/a> that the two biblical terms are interchangeable, and he traces the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epm.org\/blog\/2015\/Jun\/22\/happiness-joy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial distinction<\/a> at least back to Oswald Chambers in the mid-20th century. If Alcorn is right (I think he is), then either joy and happiness <em>both<\/em> depend on circumstances or both don\u2019t. What&#8217;s true of one will be true of the other.<\/p>\n<h3>2 Kinds of Circumstances<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cCircumstance\u201d literally means \u201cto stand around.\u201d Imagine yourself at the center of a circle, and certain objective facts stand around the circumference. Four facts surround you: you got a good night\u2019s sleep, you\u2019ve had a strong cup of coffee, your daughter just made the dean\u2019s list, and your boss just gave you a raise. The normal response to these objective facts is genuine joy. You&#8217;ll feel happy\u2014whether you&#8217;re a Christian or not.<\/p>\n<p>Now imagine the circumstantial facts are these: your allergies kept you up all night, you spilled your coffee while driving, your daughter is failing a class, and your boss just fired you. The normal response to these objective facts is genuine sorrow. You&#8217;ll feel sad\u2014whether you&#8217;re a Christian or not.<\/p>\n<p>Believers share these kinds of circumstances with unbelievers. Because of common guilt, children of God aren&#8217;t immune from the sorrow produced by the fall; because of common grace, children of wrath aren&#8217;t deprived of the joy preserved in the <em>imago Dei<\/em>. Unbelievers experience genuine joy as they receive the Creator\u2019s good gifts, even if they don\u2019t acknowledge him who satisfies their \u201chearts with food and gladness\u201d (Acts 14:17).<\/p>\n<p>Beyond the facts of this immediate circle, there&#8217;s another circle with different circumstances\u2014ultimate ones. These are the attributes, acts, and promises of God. For the unbeliever, such ultimate circumstances are bad news: God\u2019s omniscience means every secret sin is fully known; his holiness ensures judgment is inevitable; his omnipresence renders judgment inescapable. These objective facts create a terrifying ring of circumstances for the unbeliever.<\/p>\n<p>How does the unbeliever emotionally cope with these traumatic circumstances? By worshiping creation rather than the Creator and pursuing happiness in the gifts, not the Giver. Through spiritual blindness and willful denial, he cannot see beyond his immediate circumstances. Sure, replacing the living God with lifeless idols may bring joy for a season\u2014yet with diminishing returns. His idols eventually fail him.<\/p>\n<p>For the believer, the ultimate circumstances are happy facts. God\u2019s omniscience means he knows our needs; his omnipotence ensures he can meet them; his compassion moves him to care about them; his providence confirms that every unmet need has a loving (even if hidden) purpose. Facts like the immutability of God, the substitutionary atonement and triumphant resurrection of Christ, justification by faith alone, and the promise of eternal life are firmly and forever standing their ground in a circle around me. My joy is completely dependent on these ultimate circumstances.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My joy is completely dependent on my ultimate circumstances.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As Milton Vincent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Gospel-Primer-Christians-Learning-Glories\/dp\/1885904673\/tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">put it<\/a>, &#8220;The gospel is one great permanent circumstance in which I live and move; and every hardship in my life is allowed by God only because it serves his gospel purposes in me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>God of Hope<\/h3>\n<p>To be sure, we can often find joy in the happy facts of our immediate circumstances, since they&#8217;re kindly ordered by God. He \u201crichly provides us with everything to enjoy\u201d (1 Tim. 6:17): food and drink, family and friends, houses and health, Bibles and bikes, music and sports. The believer is free to have as much fun as legally possible while cheerfully obeying the laws of God and promoting the joy of others. While unbelievers hope for happiness <em>from<\/em> the world, believers hope for happiness <em>in<\/em> the world as they enjoy God\u2019s good gifts with grateful hearts.<\/p>\n<p>The missionary David Brainerd <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/65066\/65066-h\/65066-h.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acknowledged<\/a> our \u201cabsolute dependence\u201d on God for \u201cevery crumb of happiness\u201d we enjoy. Acknowledge this dependence and find guilt-free happiness in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/topics\/sleep\/deprivation-consequences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deep sleep<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/health.clevelandclinic.org\/get-happy-exercise-can-lift-mood-infographic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vigorous exercise<\/a>, good food, close friends, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/benefits-church-attendance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public worship<\/a>, meaningful work, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/family\/archive\/2023\/02\/coffee-caffeine-happiness-health-benefits\/673158\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">robust coffee<\/a>\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ligonier.org\/learn\/articles\/what-does-coram-deo-mean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>coram Deo<\/em><\/a>. When we know the Lord has done great things for us, our mouth will be \u201cfilled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy\u201d (Ps. 126:2).<\/p>\n<p>But when our joy is threatened by painful circumstances\u2014when we&#8217;re shocked by sudden loss, paralyzed by gut-wrenching grief, or weakened by chronic disease\u2014we fall back on hope. Hope is the fact-based conviction that no matter how bad things are now, they&#8217;ll get better.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus prayed in Gethsemane with no outward evidence of joy. A bitter cup sat in his immediate circumstances. Why pursue this torturous path? For \u201cthe joy that was set before him\u201d (Heb. 12:2). No matter how bad his immediate circumstances were, he knew they&#8217;d improve. For also standing beside the bleeding Son was the ultimate circumstance of an omnipotently kind Father.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While unbelievers hope for happiness <em>from <\/em>the world, believers hope for happiness <em>in<\/em> the world as they enjoy God\u2019s good gifts with grateful hearts.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As others have observed, for the unbeliever who doesn\u2019t repent, this world\u2019s fleeting joy is the closest he&#8217;ll get to heaven. For the believer, this world\u2019s momentary sorrow is the closest he&#8217;ll get to hell. This is why Paul can rejoice in prison, knowing it has actually \u201cserved to advance the gospel\u201d (Phil. 1:12). Immediate circumstance: Caesar\u2019s prison. Ultimate circumstance: God\u2019s purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Again, Paul can say to Christians weeping over fresh graves that their grief differs from the grief of those who \u201chave no hope\u201d (1 Thess. 4:13). Immediate circumstance: the believer is dead. Ultimate circumstance: the believer will be raised.<\/p>\n<h3>Dynamic Partnership<\/h3>\n<p>Joy and hope are faithful friends. \u201cTwo are better than one,\u201d and when our joy stumbles under the load of immediate circumstances, hope is there to \u201clift up his fellow\u201d (Eccl. 4:9\u201310). Hope and joy cooperate for our endurance. Hope sustains us until we can feel joy again.<\/p>\n<p>On the last day, the ultimate circumstances will swallow up our immediate circumstances, and every tear will be wiped away. Until then, by God\u2019s grace, I\u2019ll pursue joy by changing every circumstance biblical wisdom allows me to change. I\u2019ll accept every sad circumstance I\u2019m unable to change as the providence of the all-wise God. And I\u2019ll remember ancient advice: \u201cWeeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning\u201d (Ps. 30:5).<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>I began taking theology seriously around 2008, in the height of the Young, Restless, Reformed (YRR) movement in evangelicalism. At the time I was being discipled by a Methodist pastor, who trained me in the ways of \u201cfive-point\u201d Arminianism while I served under him as a youth pastor. I knew all the takedowns of \u201cfive-point\u201d Calvinist soteriology\u2014and wielded them with abandon any chance I could.<\/p>\n<p>But growing up in Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, the YRR movement was close to home, with figures such as Matt Chandler drawing a huge crowd down the road. Sure enough, I began attending The Village Church in the evenings and was soon converted to the ways of Calvinism. As one can imagine, I became skilled at wielding new arguments against my old ones.<\/p>\n<p>Many have called this \u201ccage stage\u201d Calvinism, and I was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/why-are-calvinists-so-mean\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a willing combatant<\/a>. Looking back, the most negative consequence of my time in the cage was how it (for only a time, praise God) soured my relationship with my mentor. I went from deeply respecting him as a pastor and theologian to doubting his intelligence and sincerity.<\/p>\n<p>But he hadn\u2019t changed\u2014I had.<\/p>\n<h3>Diagnosing the Cage Stage<\/h3>\n<p>The cage-stage mentality is prevalent in a variety of circles. It almost seems to be a necessary consequence of theological discovery. I see it now in those who, like me, are concerned about theological retrieval. But I hope the next generation will avoid cage-stage theological retrieval\u2014and avoid some of my generation&#8217;s mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>Here are four signs of cage-stage theology from a former practitioner.<\/p>\n<h4>1. You disdain your spiritual and theological forebears, heroes, or mentors.<\/h4>\n<p>We&#8217;re quick to critique or even slander those who came before us\u2014those who taught us!\u2014because we now feel we\u2019ve moved beyond them. We become cynical of their abilities while tending to lionize our newfound intelligence, oddly insulting our former selves who once held such beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>I wish I could track it down, but I once saw a tweet that essentially said, \u201cI disagree with [X theologian] now, but I\u2019m only able to disagree because he made me love theology in the first place.\u201d This seems like the right way to honor those who came before us. Like adult children, we shouldn&#8217;t allow pride to dishonor our (theological) parents just because we\u2019ve moved on from them in some ways. They still <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/7-reasons-i-appreciate-my-non-reformed-childhood-church\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gave us the passion and the tools to care about theology<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Like children who come into their own as adults, we shouldn\u2019t allow pride to dishonor our (theological) parents just because we\u2019ve moved on from them in some ways.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Frankly, a twenty-something seminarian railing against someone whose major work published before the student was born <em>may<\/em> be right about a few facts, but he&#8217;s rarely right in his disposition. Those of us who&#8217;ve been there recognize how hard it is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/publication\/blind-spots\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">see that blind spot<\/a> in youth\u2014but it\u2019s crucial those around him point it out. Wisdom allows for humility and graciousness, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/judge-people-like-jesus-did\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">especially in disagreement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>2. You create disciples who are cynical of their forebears, heroes, or mentors.<\/h4>\n<p>As a professor, I often see students go through the whiplash of realizing their parents, pastors, or favorite authors are apparently wrong about something. In the cage stage, it&#8217;s tempting to think decades of faithful ministry are now (or always have been) worthless and of little benefit to the academy or church. These students begin to question their mentors or friends for being too \u201cshallow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For those of us in positions of influence, let&#8217;s not fan the flames of the cage stage. In part, this requires us to correct someone when it happens. For example, I rarely allow a student to criticize her parents or pastors to me. She might think I&#8217;ll understand the silliness of her pastor\u2019s view because she heard me disagree with it, but I usually shut that conversation down.<\/p>\n<p>We also need to model this type of theological generosity. Whenever we teach, we should represent interlocutors fairly and substantially. If we don\u2019t exit the cage stage as leaders, we&#8217;ll keep breeding prideful students who don\u2019t learn to recognize how little they know\u2014and how they might disagree with themselves down the road.<\/p>\n<h4>3. You narrow orthodoxy to a neatly defined set of categories.<\/h4>\n<p>The cage stage can create a type of fundamentalism that eschews generous orthodoxy for a select \u201cin\u201d crowd reminiscent of a high school clique. It\u2019s easy to simply cut someone out of our theological friend group if he challenges or questions us. But if you\u2019re truly confident in your convictions, they can be challenged by the <em>best<\/em> of the other side. Humility allows you to hold your convictions while being open to changing your mind.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to protect your own platform or prestige. You&#8217;re not jockeying for prom king. I can\u2019t count the number of times I regurgitated that Arminians are \u201cworks-based\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t appreciate the sovereignty of God.\u201d I\u2019d even read Wesley\u2019s corpus and knew better\u2014but in the cage, you have to punch, not hug.<\/p>\n<h4>4. You tend toward personal brand building that makes you a self-appointed savior of orthodoxy.<\/h4>\n<p>We feel the need to protect our brand; after all, it\u2019s what got us whatever influence we have. At its worst, the cage stage pushes us to conveniently interpret deceased theologians as if they basically agree with us. This is a great way to win cheap points in a debate, but not to do theology or history.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Humility allows you to hold your convictions while being open to changing your mind.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s tempting to create history in our own image\u2014anachronistically or shallowly arguing that past theologians agree with all of our little pet nuances. Critiquing them becomes a direct critique of us.<\/p>\n<p>We all have a long way to go. Sin is always creeping. But beware of \u201cus vs. them\u201d theologians who frame all discourse around their role in saving you from an enemy (whether a person or a generic \u201cthem\u201d). Paul directly warns the Corinthians against an \u201cI belong to Paul\u201d or \u201cI belong to Apollos\u201d mentality (1 Cor. 3:4). Instead, he later says, \u201cLove bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things\u201d (13:7).<\/p>\n<h3>Theological Neighbor-Love<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s basic neighbor-love to ask clarifying questions of those with whom you disagree. I imagine Satan loves it when we assume bad motives, judge a person\u2019s theology or character based on one tweet or article, or use others\u2019 failures as a prop for our own platforms.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s tragic, then, that Christians are sometimes the most vicious to one another. When we\u2019re in the cage, we&#8217;re unable to see <em>outside<\/em> it\u2014lacking the wisdom to judge between biblical discernment and church-destroying divisiveness.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What if we modeled eschatological unity rather than myopic division?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Instead, we can all pray that God would break our pride, soften our hearts, and give us the wisdom to balance conviction with neighbor-love. Thinking back to the church in Corinth, Paul seems willing to allow them to disagree about a whole host of issues\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/what-god-values-more-than-your-motives\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">so long as they unite around the gospel<\/a>. This unity must include generosity toward our forebears and introspection about our own convictions and abilities.<\/p>\n<p>The reality is that all the senseless division between brothers and sisters in Christ will be eradicated in the new creation. We&#8217;ll live in a fellowship of unity and forgiveness for all eternity, thanks to the One who overcomes our rivalries. In the meantime, what if we modeled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/video\/gospel-foundation-christian-unity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eschatological unity<\/a> rather than myopic division? What if we try harder, by the power of the Spirit, to treat each other as we will in the new creation?<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>In recent years, a new vision of human flourishing has entered the church: self-care. \u201cSelf-care\u201d is now one of the most common terms used to discuss personal and spiritual health, and it means different things to different people. It can be used to reference basic needs like sleep and exercise, or bingeing a new show, or prayer retreats in the woods.<\/p>\n<p>On the surface, self-care seems like an unarguable commitment\u2014of course we need to care for ourselves. But when cultural messages about self-care aren\u2019t reframed by biblical principles of mutual care, this can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/10\/other-care-self-care\/620441\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">negatively affect us personally<\/a>, and a church&#8217;s culture corporately. The church that prioritizes care for self over care for others will suffer shallow relationships, a misunderstanding of sanctification, and complacency in evangelism.<\/p>\n<h3>Balance Self-Care and Mutual Care<\/h3>\n<p>The gospel\u2019s beauty shines when we no longer live for ourselves but lovingly care for others out of a transformed heart (2 Cor. 5:11\u201321). After all, spiritual growth begins in the heart, but it manifests through intentional expressions of care for others (Col. 3:1\u20134:6).<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no either-or here. Our churches should prioritize the healthy development of the self but do so cautiously, lest we neglect the beauty and belonging that come when a local church practices the New Testament\u2019s one-another commands.<\/p>\n<h3>Growth Needs Friends<\/h3>\n<p>Self-care without mutual care seldom produces deep and vulnerable relationships. It instead promotes isolation and self-protection. If this tendency is unaddressed, a church can become a place filled with individuals but not brothers and sisters. Church leaders must have a unified commitment to developing the whole body, not simply the parts. The development of a whole person happens in the context of the church\u2019s whole-body life.<\/p>\n<p>Belonging to a local church will mean being highly relational. Members commit not simply to attending services together but to engaging with one another\u2019s lives (Heb. 10:24\u201325). This requires initiative and vulnerability, moving toward one another with the goal of mutual care (Rom. 12:3\u201313). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/use-gifts-local-church\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mutual care is an essential dynamic<\/a> (Col. 1:28\u201329; 1 Thess. 5:14) because it\u2019s required for spiritual growth. <span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">A church community catalyzes growth by helping one another understand and apply God\u2019s Word (Col. 3:16). Mutual input, encouragement, and admonishment contribute to their corporate sanctification.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Preoccupation with self-care can lead a church to focus on individual markers of growth more than communal ones. While spiritual growth does happen in individual hearts, we can\u2019t forget that this change occurs in the context of a community where others\u2019 feedback pushes us to live outside self-imposed guidelines.<\/p>\n<h3>Not Professionalized Friendship<\/h3>\n<p>The self-care obsession of our culture can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/fobo-genz-fomo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inadvertently make personal wellness the goal of every friendship<\/a>. Some people today are tempted to avoid relationships that would cost them time and energy. Others pursue relationships with well-connected people and only vulnerably interact with professionals.<\/p>\n<p>Professionals can play a strategic role in a Christian\u2019s process of sanctification, but in the church, we have peer relationships built on a common commitment to biblical principles. Over the long haul, these ordinary friendships that both give and receive care are the most meaningful part of our growth and change.<\/p>\n<h3>Growth Needs a Joyful Outward Focus<\/h3>\n<p>The temptation to neglect mutual care influences our relationships not only with those in the church but also with those outside.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Ordinary friendships that both give and receive care are the most meaningful part of our growth and change.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Evangelism is often demanding and intimidating. Overemphasizing self-care could discourage evangelistic efforts that feel too demanding for the individual Christian. But counterintuitively, the spiritual growth and wellness of a Christ-follower are enhanced when he or she engages the lost world with the hope of the gospel. Avoiding evangelism (or simply <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/blogs\/trevin-wax\/self-care-self-absorption\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trying to make it easier<\/a>) won\u2019t lead to flourishing inside or outside the church. Faithful evangelism, by contrast, leads to joy.<\/p>\n<p>Our journeys of discipleship must be holistic. Don\u2019t let excessive concern with self-care move your church off course. Cultivate the sorts of relationships in your church that will both develop the self and build up Christ\u2019s body.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>After years of evangelical teaching on \u201cengaging popular culture,\u201d Christian families are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theamericanconservative.com\/gender-ideology-saving-your-child-from-the-village-transgender-lgbt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">facing renewed calls to withdraw from secular entertainment<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s warnings sound more urgent than older cautions about pop culture. After all, newer young-adult fantasy novels don\u2019t just market violence; they also include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/list\/show\/124633.Trans_YA_Fiction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">characters with trans identities<\/a>. Streaming shows like <i>The Last of Us<\/i> aren\u2019t just rife with curse words; they\u2019re also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.esquire.com\/uk\/culture\/a42686416\/the-last-of-us-gay-romance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">endorsing same-sex entanglements<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>How should wise Christians respond to today\u2019s calls to reject\u2014rather than winsomely engage\u2014secular entertainment? What does pop-culture engagement look like in a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.firstthings.com\/article\/2022\/02\/the-three-worlds-of-evangelicalism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">negative world<\/a>,\u201d which no longer praises or tolerates public expressions of biblical faith but actually treats Christianity as a dangerous threat to the newer religion of tolerance and sexual autonomy?<\/p>\n<h3>How Christians Learned to Embrace Pop-Culture Engagement<\/h3>\n<p>When I was a child, I began studying how to \u201cengage popular culture\u201d by reading a 1986 book meant for Christian parents. <a href=\"https:\/\/lorehaven.com\/podcast\/43-how-did-a-1980s-evangelical-book-warn-about-turmoil-in-the-toy-box\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Its cover featured a toy box dispatched by the Devil<\/a>, and its author tried to contrast appropriate childhood play with (what he saw as) consumerism and occult imagery in <i>He-Man<\/i> and <i>The Smurfs<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>I found this book a decade late, in the \u201990s. It wasn\u2019t long before evangelical writers were reacting against this combative mode of pop-culture engagement, proposing a more conversational approach. Think pieces proliferated. Bloggers wrote movie reviews. Websites like <a href=\"http:\/\/christandpopculture.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christ and Pop Culture<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/thinkchristian.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Think Christian<\/a> launched. Books proliferated with titles like <i>Finding God in . . .<\/i> or <i>The Gospel According to . . .<\/i>, displaying an eagerness to discern the virtues and theological themes of <i>The Simpsons<\/i>, <i>Star Wars<\/i>, or <i>Superman<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>Most of these resources reject legalistic impulses. They favor a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/essay\/goodness-god-common-grace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">common-grace<\/a> approach, accepting that God created humans in his own image and bestows gifts even on the unrighteous (Matt. 5:45). This truth means our Creator\u2019s image will always be reflected, however dimly, in popular culture made by God\u2019s image-bearers.<\/p>\n<p>Such resources still edify me. Many help articulate, say, <a href=\"https:\/\/christandpopculture.com\/ive-never-been-so-happy-to-see-so-many-wrinkles-how-star-trek-picard-aged-gracefully\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">why <i>Star Trek: Picard<\/i> season 3 so beautifully grew its <i>Next Generation<\/i> heroes<\/a> or why we feel vicarious grief at the sacrificial deaths of Superman and Iron Man. They explain why we cringe at shallow Christian social-drama movies. They help us <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/let-my-kids-watch-this\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">train kids<\/a> to think critically.<\/p>\n<p>Still, like anything, this evangelical movement of pop-culture engagement includes some blind spots\u2014and it may be aging poorly in today\u2019s rapidly changing world.<\/p>\n<h3>New Hazards in Pop Culture<\/h3>\n<p>Last spring, leaked audio revealed a Disney creative executive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalreview.com\/news\/disney-executive-producer-admits-to-gay-agenda-adding-queerness-wherever-she-could\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">boasting of a \u201cnot-at-all-secret gay agenda.\u201d<\/a> That news\u2014while perhaps unsurprising to conservatives\u2014mobilized parents in ways that probably helped doom two 2022 Disney movies: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/lightyear-top-gun-maverick\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Lightyear<\/i><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/disneys-strange-world\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Strange World<\/i><\/a>. Beyond the Mouse House, many makers of kids&#8217; content now seem locked in a sexual-revolutionary arms race to develop the <i>first<\/i> divergent-identity characters, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JUDbwWxTExQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the first \u201cdrag queen\u201d on <i>Blue\u2019s Clues<\/i><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/09\/25\/entertainment\/gonzorella-nonbinary-childrens-tv-cec\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the first cross-dressing Baby Muppet<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VocabMalone\/status\/1654186376152113152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the first \u201cnonbinary\u201d Transformer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Because of this, some millennial parents are shifting away from the \u201clegalism is bad!\u201d mindset and coming to see that maybe their parents in the \u201980s weren\u2019t crazy to put strict limits around their media consumption. Other concerned adults are going on the offense, whether through YouTube creators who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KuREaFVr-Vc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mock the \u201cwoke\u201d messages of geek-franchise movies<\/a>\u00a0or companies like The Daily Wire that have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailywire.com\/episode\/introducing-dw-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced their own direct competition to Disney<\/a>. Other conservative groups publish their own resources, promising to counter the mainstream fare with alternative stories that celebrate Judeo-Christian morality and classical virtue.<\/p>\n<h3>We Live in a \u2018Negative World\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>In today\u2019s world, the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/reviews\/watching-tv-religiously\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gospel according to secular pop culture<\/a>\u201d genre feels increasingly naive, even foolish. With respect, I suggest that such resources\u2014for all their strengths\u2014fail to acknowledge the growing observation that Christians now live in a \u201cnegative world.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.firstthings.com\/article\/2022\/02\/the-three-worlds-of-evangelicalism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As writer Aaron Renn describes this<\/a>, we&#8217;ve seen three general stages of culture secularization, from the \u201cpositive world\u201d (ending around 1994) to the \u201cneutral world\u201d (1994 to 2014), and finally the &#8220;negative world&#8221; (up to the present). There&#8217;s ongoing debate about this framing among Christians, but I see value in Renn\u2019s construction. Renn writes of the negative world,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Society has come to have a <i>negative<\/i> view of Christianity. Being known as a Christian is a social negative, particularly in the elite domains of society. Christian morality is expressly repudiated and seen as a threat to the public good and the new public moral order. Subscribing to Christian moral views or violating the secular moral order brings negative consequences.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps some of the older evangelical pop-culture engagement worked in Renn\u2019s neutral world. But even then, these resources had limits.<\/p>\n<p>Some advocates of \u201cengaging pop culture\u201d focused more on pragmatic evangelism than personal holiness. Their emphasis on winsome public witness sometimes minimized our need to proclaim the biblical gospel and the full counsel of God\u2014complete with its \u201chard sayings\u201d (John 6:60). This implied our non-Christian neighbors would consider Jesus Christ if only we signaled our shared enjoyment of superheroes or prestige streaming shows.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Some advocates of \u2018engaging pop culture\u2019 focused more on pragmatic evangelism than personal holiness.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A few of these authors also seemed to find secular culture much friendlier than the nasty place their Christian ancestors had warned them about. This led them to resentful postures toward \u201cevangelical culture\u201d (with all its embarrassing \u201cpurity\u201d and cheesy low aesthetic standards) and positivity about \u201cpopular culture.\u201d In their haste to affirm common grace, they neglected Scripture\u2019s warnings about cultural idolatries. Yet for every reminder about Paul\u2019s \u201caltar to the unknown god\u201d missional method (Acts 17:23), we must also recall that evil humans exchange \u201cthe glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man\u201d and creatures (Rom. 1:23).<\/p>\n<p>Common grace may help us see popular culture\u2019s goodness. But only Christ\u2019s saving grace can help us gain eternal life\u2014and <i>then<\/i> hope for culture\u2019s future redemption.<\/p>\n<h3>Rebooting Pop-Culture Engagement for a Negative World<\/h3>\n<p>In spite of my critiques, I don\u2019t think Christians should reject every old idea about pop-culture engagement. I think we should wisely update these approaches to cultural engagement for today\u2019s negative world, taking care to discern when we should resist elements of pop culture as fundamentally idolatrous and when to receive them as common-grace gifts (to use Brad East\u2019s terms in his <a href=\"https:\/\/mereorthodoxy.com\/once-more-church-and-culture\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">helpful recent article<\/a>). For different age groups, practical applications might look like the following.<\/p>\n<h4>For Younger Children<\/h4>\n<p>In a world where Disney cartoons don\u2019t just repeat \u201cbelieve in yourself\u201d but overtly undermine biblical sexual ethics, we can\u2019t just praise the fun quips, \u201csafe\u201d lack of curse words, and feel-good vibes. Let\u2019s get real, and let\u2019s get ahead of the not-so-secret agendas.<\/p>\n<p>Start the training early, using age-appropriate comparisons: \u201cSome people believe so-and-so about men and women. But here\u2019s how the Bible says God created us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you might even avoid certain streaming services or books for younger children. This isn\u2019t legalism or \u201cbook banning.\u201d Rather, you\u2019re acting as a responsible shepherd, like a pastor called to protect his flock from false teaching.<\/p>\n<h4>For Older Children<\/h4>\n<p>Start adding weight to their lifting. They\u2019re nearing the stage of needing to navigate this world on their own, and you must prepare them to survive with their faith intact. Even if the negative world gets worse, a total-withdrawal strategy can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/blogs\/erik-raymond\/how-to-exasperate-your-children-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exasperate your children<\/a>, provoking their curiosity about The Secular World along with vulnerability to its temptations. Many of us have experienced this ourselves, so let\u2019s learn from our own examples and not repeat the same cycle.<\/p>\n<p>Carefully permit your children to explore more popular culture. Praise any common grace, including creative excellence, but challenge idolatries: \u201cWhy does the hero think this will make her happy? According to the rules of this fictional world, can that even work? In our real world, does that idea glorify Jesus or the flesh?\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>For Adults (Including Ourselves)<\/h4>\n<p>We must also ask challenging questions and guard ourselves against pop culture\u2019s temptations and insidious agendas. This includes the usual suspects like that TV show hoping to sell you a sexual revolution. But also take note that some pundits warning about pop culture may have their own agendas.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Praise any common grace, including creative excellence, but challenge idolatries.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That &#8220;anti-woke&#8221; YouTuber may not love Jesus as much as he loves bashing a mutual enemy in order to sell you his Christ-less \u201ctraditional\u201d idols guaranteed to beat the leftist gods. These pundits are just as much popular culture as the stuff on Paramount Plus. Test all of this equally, wielding biblical wisdom as your standard.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever you eat or drink\u2014whatever you hear on your podcast player or scroll past on your smartphone\u2014do it all for God\u2019s glory (1 Cor. 10:31). Our mission isn\u2019t to practice mere \u201cwinsomeness\u201d in our age nor merely to cope with the culture, however bad it gets. Our purpose is to glorify Jesus forever, no matter how negative our world.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>I have to write about unbiblical topics for corporate communications. Is that sinful?<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From advertisements and entertainment to company memos and social media posts, we see unbiblical messages every day. A lot of the content we consume has been crafted by paid professionals. A graphic designer created the billboard that caught your eye on the way to work. Someone in an office put together the memo that just slid into your inbox. An author wrote the nonfiction book that sits on your nightstand.<\/p>\n<p>As corporate culture pivots from once-mainstream Christian morals and ideals, your question will likely become more and more important.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there are instances in which it makes sense for Christians to write about unbiblical topics for the purpose of clarity, teaching, or general awareness. But in this article, I\u2019ll assume you&#8217;re being asked to write about unbiblical topics in a way that promotes certain sins as aspirational ideals. Let me offer a few thoughts.<\/p>\n<h3>Uphold the Goals of the Christian Life<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All Christians working in secular settings need to consider the role they play in bringing certain messages to fruition. You cannot fully separate yourself from the words you pen. While you may be responding to an assignment from your employer, you&#8217;re ultimately the one putting those words out into the world. And so you bear responsibility for what they say.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let&#8217;s consider if your writing can exist in harmony with some of the foundational purposes of the Christian life.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Glorify God.<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An oft-recited answer at the beginning of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apuritansmind.com\/westminster-standards\/shorter-catechism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Westminster Shorter Catechism<\/a> states that \u201cman\u2019s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.\u201d Does the work you do allow you to fulfill that purpose? Or does it hinder you? Is God glorified through your writing?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While you may be responding to an assignment from your employer, you&#8217;re ultimately the one putting those words out into the world.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all vocational writing will be explicitly faith-based. You may write mathematics textbooks, payroll policies, or the user manual that comes in the box with a new air fryer. Even the most mundane or seemingly unspiritual tasks can glorify God through our work ethic, our truth telling, and our service of clients and colleagues. In many jobs, we can \u201cwork heartily, as for the Lord\u201d (Col. 3:23). But we can\u2019t glorify God while creating content that works against his commands.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Advance his kingdom.<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s much kingdom work to be done in the secular marketplace. But if you play any role in advancing messages that promote sin, you&#8217;re working <em>against<\/em> the kingdom of God. You may be causing others to stumble into sin (Mark 9:42), and their sin will separate them from God (Isa. 59:2).<\/p>\n<h4>3. Keep his commands.<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;re charged with keeping the commands of Scripture (2 Tim. 3:16\u201317), and the Bible isn&#8217;t silent regarding our communication:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cI tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.\u201d (Matt. 12:36\u201337)<\/li>\n<li>\u201cLet no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up.\u201d (Eph. 4:29)<\/li>\n<li>\u201cSet a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips!\u201d (Ps. 141:3)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Knowing When to Leave (and How to Stay)<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until Jesus returns, we all live <em>and labor<\/em> in the presence of sin. Acknowledging that fact, we should carefully consider how we interact with communication that glorifies rebellion against God\u2019s design. Sometimes we can be used in positive ways within secular work environments. There are also instances where it might be wisest to look for a different job.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you move forward, consider your specific options. Do you have influence within your organization? Are you able to advocate for changing the nature of the messages put out by your team? You may be uniquely positioned to provide a different voice or perspective for your employer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren\u2019t in a position of influence, consider how often you&#8217;re asked to write about topics that conflict with your beliefs. If it\u2019s a one-time or rare occasion, you may have grounds to make a request based on your sincerely held religious beliefs. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 exists to protect religious liberties in the workplace. If an accommodation wouldn&#8217;t cause unreasonable hardship to your employer, you may have more options than you think. Could you opt out of this assignment but take on more work in another area?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Until Jesus returns, we all live and labor in the presence of sin.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are no available options, it might be time to look for other employment. As a Christian, you have the gift of the Holy Spirit (John 14:26). You posed your question because you may have felt unsettled when asked to write about certain topics. It\u2019s possible the Spirit is creating some unease within you to nudge you away from a task or even a job.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take time to consider your assignments and the ideas they promote. And as you do, prayerfully seek discernment to move forward in a way that allows you to glorify God, advance his kingdom, and keep his commands.<\/p>\n",

We can speculate about the agenda of those who seek out these stories, and see all too clearly what they missed, glossed over, or got wrong. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will inevitably be examples of where these storytellers paint with too broad a brush or give a free platform to people eager to throw stones at a faith they\u2019ve left behind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This would be an understandable reaction to Amazon\u2019s four-part docuseries <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Shiny-Happy-People-Duggar-Secrets\/dp\/B0B8TR2QV5\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Shiny Happy People<\/i><\/a>, now streaming on Prime Video.<\/p>\n<p>The series focuses on the Duggars\u2014the ultraconservative homeschool family made famous by TLC\u2019s hit reality show <i>19 Kids and Counting<\/i> then rocked by sexual abuse, infidelity, and child pornography scandals perpetrated by their oldest son. It also explores the influence of disgraced Christian teacher Bill Gothard, one of the most powerful leaders of the Christian homeschooling movement and a key proponent of \u201cQuiverfull\u201d theology (i.e., that parents should, in obedience to Psalm 127, have as many children as God will give them). In 2014, Gothard resigned from his sprawling parachurch organization, the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP), after dozens of women accused him of sexual abuse and harassment going back decades.<\/p>\n<p>Coming on the heels of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hulu.com\/series\/41cb2b50-df48-485c-8963-0aafca4a8601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>The Secrets of<\/i> <i>Hillsong<\/i><\/a> (FX\/Hulu) and last year\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hulu.com\/movie\/god-forbid-the-sex-scandal-that-brought-down-a-dynasty-d0c5802f-05ec-4826-9390-f9ceca67f3e0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>God Forbid<\/i><\/a> (Hulu) on Liberty University\u2019s Jerry Falwell Jr., it may be hard for some in the church to stomach yet another expos\u00e9 of abuse, hypocrisy, and downright weirdness by those who claim the name of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>The temptation is to tune out. But should we?<\/p>\n<h3>Full Disclosure<\/h3>\n<p>Before going further, I should confess I\u2019m not an impartial reviewer.<\/p>\n<p>I grew up at the forefront of the Christian homeschooling movement. My parents, Gregg and Sono Harris, were prominent homeschool leaders in the 1980s and \u201990s and educated me and my six siblings at home. While we weren&#8217;t involved in IBLP, I had many close friends who were. And my family and I helped popularize to a more mainstream evangelical audience some of the same ideas Gothard promoted: from homeschooling and \u201ccourtship\u201d to strict rules for female modesty and obedience to authority.<\/p>\n<p>I had a wonderful homeschool experience, for which I\u2019ll always be grateful. At its best, I see in the Christian homeschooling movement a work of genuine educational reform and spiritual renewal for countless families.<\/p>\n<p>But while I remain firmly in the fold, I have peers\u2014including members of my own family\u2014who have left the church, rejecting not just their upbringing but faith itself in response to evils they experienced and false gospels they were taught.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps more unusual for a reviewer, I also appear in several episodes of <i>Shiny Happy People<\/i>. A year ago, the filmmakers invited me to sit down for an interview, not to talk about the Duggars or Gothard but to discuss the bigger story of the Christian homeschooling movement and the \u201cJoshua Generation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Joshua Generation is an influential concept\u2014one I embraced most of my life\u2014that my generation would rise up and attain positions of power and influence in government, law, and beyond, and in so doing help restore the United States as a Christian nation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are many problems with that vision of political engagement, and this isn&#8217;t the place to get into them fully. Suffice it to say that as believers our hope isn&#8217;t in princes or earthly power, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/video\/why-america-is-not-a-christian-nation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the United States isn&#8217;t a new Israel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But the Joshua Generation story is one worth telling. It\u2019s an ambitious plot that has been far more successful than most people realize, and it helps explain much of our current political, cultural, and spiritual moment. To the extent someone was trying to tell even part of that story, I wanted to help them do it accurately\u2014ideally paired with a more biblical vision for Christian engagement with politics and culture.<\/p>\n<p>I also chose to participate to make clear that even those of us with good homeschool experiences have real concerns about aspects of the movement, to buttress the voices of those understandably hurt and even angry.<\/p>\n<p>It can be far too easy for those of us in the church to dismiss the stories of those who&#8217;ve \u201cdeconstructed\u201d; to take issue with their choices, tone, and new beliefs (or lack thereof); and to move much too quickly past the sins, abuses, and hypocrisies that caused so much pain.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It can be far too easy for those of us in the church to dismiss the stories of those who have \u2018deconstructed\u2019 and to move much too quickly past the sins, abuses, and hypocrisies that caused so much pain.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I spent a full day with the filmmakers last July, knowing I\u2019d ultimately have no control over which of my words would be used or how they\u2019d be used. I\u2019ve spent the past 11 months wondering how it would all turn out.<\/p>\n<h3>Searing, Imperfect Series<\/h3>\n<p>The wait is finally over and, while far from perfect, <i>Shiny Happy People<\/i> accomplishes its primary goal: it\u2019s a searing indictment of Gothard&#8217;s teachings and, for those previously unfamiliar with it, a thorough introduction to the rotten fruit of the IBLP empire.<\/p>\n<p>The narrative is engrossing and deeply troubling, weaving together archival footage and IBLP materials with compelling interviews with individuals who grew up in IBLP\u2014most notably Jill Duggar Dillard, one of the oldest Duggar daughters, whose words and revelations anchor much of the series.<\/p>\n<p>I know people who had positive experiences with IBLP. These were homeschool families with parents who genuinely sought to honor God and do what was best for their children. I also know people who experienced every bit of the trauma the series exposes.<\/p>\n<p><i>Shiny Happy People<\/i> is in many ways an ideal supplement to a book by another of the Duggar daughters, Jinger Duggar Vuolo. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Becoming-Free-Indeed-Story-Disentangling\/dp\/1400335817\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Becoming Free Indeed<\/i><\/a>, Vuolo engages in a systematic theological takedown of Gothard\u2019s controlling, fear-based, and gospel-distorting teachings, sharing her own journey of disentangling her faith and holding on to Christ. <i>Shiny Happy People<\/i> brings Gothard\u2019s false teachings to life. Vuolo\u2019s book provides hope that true gospel faith can rise from the ashes.<\/p>\n<p>The series\u2019s strength might also be its biggest weakness, especially for an evangelical audience. With its focus on the Duggars, Gothard, and IBLP, the episodes can feel narrow\u2014a sordid story about \u201cother people.\u201d On the few occasions the filmmakers try to connect Gothard\u2019s teachings to broader themes in Christianity, the attempts are invariably heavy handed, often equating Gothard\u2019s genuine extremism with beliefs held by the vast majority of evangelicals. That may have been a considered choice on the filmmakers\u2019 part, but it preaches to the choir of evangelicalism\u2019s detractors rather than engaging in the more difficult task of persuasion.<\/p>\n<p>The series does include a segment on the Joshua Generation, but the discussion is ultimately superficial, with little to no exploration of the context, ideas, or individuals behind the movement or attempt to accurately situate it within the larger \u201cChristian Right\u201d and our current political moment. Perhaps most disappointing to me, there&#8217;s no discussion of what a more faithful approach to <a href=\"https:\/\/erlc.com\/resource-library\/articles\/seeking-the-welfare-of-the-city-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christian political engagement<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/andcampaign.org\/\">might look like<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Why We Shouldn\u2019t Look the Other Way<\/h3>\n<p>Despite <i>Shiny Happy People<\/i>\u2019s shortcomings, it&#8217;d be a great loss to the church if thoughtful Christians, pastors, and other ministry leaders choose to look the other way.<\/p>\n<p>Looking the other way is how this happened in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>While he has few defenders in high places these days, and while some now attempt to dismiss his influence, Gothard is no fringe figure. His father served for a time as the executive director of The Gideons International, and Gothard received two degrees from Wheaton College. Long before turning his attention to a burgeoning Christian homeschool community in the 1980s, Gothard was presenting his \u201cBasic Seminar\u201d to packed coliseums around the country and winning the support and patronage of prominent Christian politicians, businessmen, and ministry leaders.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Despite <i>Shiny Happy People<\/i>\u2019s shortcomings, it\u2019d be a great loss to the church if thoughtful Christians, pastors, and other ministry leaders choose to look the other way.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And yet even a cursory examination of Gothard\u2019s core teachings reveals his distortion of the gospel. Strict obedience to Gothard\u2019s \u201cprinciples\u201d guarantees spiritual and material success, like a fundamentalist version of the \u201cprosperity\u201d or \u201chealth and wealth\u201d gospel. Disobedience opens you to Satan\u2019s attacks and sudden disaster.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever wisdom or biblical insight was otherwise included in IBLP materials, the end result was a controlling, fear-based religion, where women and children were especially vulnerable to abuse of all kinds.<\/p>\n<p>To be sure, there were some early criticisms of Gothard\u2019s principles, but those were few and far between. Tragically, it turned out that many who were quick to spot \u201cliberal drift\u201d and denounce the prosperity preachers on TV had little to say about an ultraconservative Bible teacher shaping the daily lives of millions.<\/p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.recoveringgrace.org\/media\/Anything-Wrong-G-R-Fisher.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article in a 1984 issue<\/a> of <i>The<\/i> <i>Journal of Pastoral<\/i> <i>Practice<\/i> suggests part of the reason was pastors \u201cnot wanting to run the risk of offending their congregation or constituency,\u201d among whom Gothard likely had some \u201cavid followers.\u201d That article was published only a few years after the first major sex abuse scandal in Gothard\u2019s organization, including public accusations of impropriety and \u201cmoral failures\u201d involving Gothard and a secretary.<\/p>\n<p>How many evils could have been prevented if faithful Christians hadn\u2019t looked away?<\/p>\n<p>As Christians, we should be willing to listen to and humbly learn from criticism, even when imperfectly delivered.<\/p>\n<p>For those willing to answer that call, <i>Shiny Happy People<\/i> is a good place to start.<\/p>\n",

Here\u2019s why Christian parents should be concerned\u2014and what we can do to protect our kids.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Background: <\/strong>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2023\/05\/23\/surgeon-general-issues-advisory-about-social-media-risks-for-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">surgeon general\u2019s warning<\/a> comes in response to growing scrutiny over the harmful effects of inappropriate content on and excessive use of social media. These platforms have been linked to a range of harmful consequences, from disrupted sleep patterns to promoting suicidal thoughts among young people.<\/p>\n<p>Murthy has called for policymakers, platforms, and parents to establish safe limits, and he believes children shouldn&#8217;t join social media before the age of 13. The Biden administration is simultaneously releasing plans to improve online safety for children that include establishing an interagency task force, promoting digital literacy and habits, and supporting efforts to prevent online harassment and child abuse.<\/p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2023\/05\/23\/surgeon-general-issues-advisory-about-social-media-risks-for-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated<\/a> 95 percent of teenagers and 40 percent of children aged 8\u201312 are on social media, often exposed to extreme and harmful content. Those spending more than three hours a day on these platforms are twice as likely to experience depression and anxiety. Additionally, one-third or more of girls aged 11\u201315 have reported feeling \u201caddicted\u201d to certain platforms.<\/p>\n<p>As family researchers Jenet Erickson and W. Bradford Wilcox <a href=\"https:\/\/ifstudies.org\/blog\/our-teenage-girls-are-suffering-utah-can-lead-the-way-in-helping-them\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">point out<\/a>,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Newer research indicates that yes, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.judiciary.senate.gov\/imo\/media\/doc\/Haidt%20Testimony.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social media is a factor<\/a>, with some adolescents and young adults especially affected by platforms like TikTok and Instagram. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-022-29296-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">largest study<\/a> to date found that girls between the ages of 11\u201313 appeared to be especially vulnerable. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook\u2019s<\/a> own research, leaked by a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/10\/05\/1043377310\/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-congress),\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whistleblower last year<\/a>, revealed a link for teen girls between Instagram use and increased suicidal thoughts (13.5%), eating disorders (17%) and feeling worse about their bodies (32%). [links in original]<\/p>\n<p><strong>What It Means: <\/strong>Human inventions are part of God\u2019s common grace to mankind, and most have the potential to be used for our flourishing. However, in our focus on the potential benefits of technology, we often downplay or dismiss the obvious harm and suffering they can cause. This has been especially true of communication technologies like social media. While Christians, in particular, have been slow to respond to the threat of social media, we can no longer ignore the effects on our children and teens.<\/p>\n<p>We should become more aware of how communication technologies shape our thinking and interactions. Harold Innis, a 20th-century communication theorist, posited that media technologies have <a href=\"https:\/\/eric.ed.gov\/?id=ED122268\">three profound effects<\/a> on us: they shape (1) the structure of our interests, (2) the character of symbols, and (3) the nature of community. Applying this model to social media reveals significant areas of concern.<\/p>\n<p>The structure of interests refers to the subjects that hold our attention. In this age of algorithms, social media can greatly influence what our children and teens think about. It&#8217;s unsurprising there&#8217;s been a skyrocketing number of teens exploring and engaging in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/faqs-parents-know-peer-contagion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bisexuality, eating disorders, and transgenderism<\/a> when social media sites have been promoting those topics to teens.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy for teens to start with a worthy interest and be led down a path to suffering. A teenager interested in fitness might receive an onslaught of posts promoting unrealistic body ideals, leading to body dissatisfaction and unhealthy behaviors. Social media algorithms may then point them to proanorexia (\u201cpro-ana\u201d) and probulimia sites and to online communities where they can <a href=\"https:\/\/publications.aap.org\/pediatrics\/article-abstract\/137\/1\/e20153372\/52854\/Proanorexia-Communities-on-Social-Media?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interact with others who promote \u201cthinspiration\u201d<\/a> (i.e., \u201cinspirational\u201d pictures of extremely thin bodies).<\/p>\n<p>The character of symbols, or the ways we interpret and communicate information, has also been revolutionized by social media. Platforms tend to favor brevity and instant gratification, reducing complex ideas to emojis, hashtags, and viral challenges. This shift can undermine critical thinking skills and encourage a superficial understanding of issues, such as the Bible and faith. Rather than turning to parents, pastors, or mature adults who can help them navigate their questions and doubts, teens are encouraged to learn from their frivolous and ill-informed peers.<\/p>\n<p>The nature of community is greatly affected by social media. While these platforms offer a way to connect with others, they promote shallow, fleeting interactions over meaningful, deep relationships. This can impair the development of critical social skills such as empathy and conflict resolution.<\/p>\n<p>Teens tend to confuse social media with \u201creal life.\u201d On platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, users are regularly exposed to idealized and often unrealistic portrayals of the lives of others. Seeing peers and celebrities flaunting their \u201cperfect\u201d (often photoshopped) bodies, luxurious lifestyles, and flawless appearances can lead to unhealthy comparisons and a distorted self-image. Many teens and preteens feel pressured to meet these unattainable standards, which can lead to body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and eating disorders.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/teach-children-deal-bullying\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cyberbullying<\/a> is another significant issue. Before the internet, bullying was mostly confined to school grounds. Now, it has infiltrated homes through screens. Online platforms have become a breeding ground for harassment, trolling, and abuse, where anonymity often emboldens bullies (as any adult who has been on Twitter can attest). The effects of cyberbullying can be devastating, leading to anxiety, depression, and, in extreme cases, suicidal ideation. According to a survey by Pew Research taken in 2022, nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/internet\/2022\/12\/15\/teens-and-cyberbullying-2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">half of U.S. teens aged 13 to 17 (46 percent)<\/a> report ever experiencing at least one of six cyberbullying behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>What can we do to protect our children? While the Bible doesn\u2019t say anything directly about social media, it has a lot to say about considering the company we keep and avoiding negative influences:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm. (Prov. 13:20)<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. (Prov. 1:10)<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Do not be deceived: \u201cBad company ruins good morals.\u201d (1 Cor. 15:33)<\/p>\n<p>We can\u2019t completely control who children and teens are exposed to online. But we can pray earnestly to the one who cares for the souls of children and welcomes them into his kingdom. We can ask him to work in their hearts and the hearts of those around them, keeping their feet from evil ways and causing them to delight in him above all.<\/p>\n<p>Parents also can and should take greater precautions to protect their children. The most effective way is to limit or take away their access to smartphones. As <a href=\"https:\/\/ifstudies.org\/blog\/memo-to-the-surgeon-general-right-diagnosis-wrong-treatment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leonard Sax says<\/a>,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">As a family doctor, I pay attention to these nuts and bolts. I advise parents to install parental monitoring software on any device with Internet access, to enforce limits on social media use. Common Sense Media <a href=\"http:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/articles\/parents-ultimate-guide-to-parental-controls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recommends<\/a> Net Nanny and Qustodio, as well as Bark or Circle, among other parental monitoring apps.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Explain to your teen that the use of a smartphone is a privilege, not a right. Inappropriate use of the smartphone will result in forfeiture of that privilege. What constitutes inappropriate use? Downloading or sharing obscene photos is inappropriate use. Cyberbullying is inappropriate use. Posting nasty comments anonymously is inappropriate use. A parental monitoring app will let you know whether any of this is happening, and it\u2019s the job of parents to know. [link in original]<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy advice to parents: don\u2019t wait for state or federal legislation,\u201d adds Sax. \u201cYou could be waiting a long time. Parents need to act now.\u201d<\/p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>My dad started attending Christ Covenant Church in Matthews, North Carolina, in October 1993. Dad had just moved to Charlotte for a new job, and one of his friends invited him. The growing church under the leadership of pastor-teacher Harry Reeder met in an auxiliary gym at the time. There was nowhere near enough space for the entire congregation, so Reeder preached three times on Sunday mornings in addition to the evening worship service.<\/p>\n<p>From those early days of Christ Covenant, Reeder\u2014through his teaching, leadership, and even humor\u2014discipled my dad. My dad, in turn, discipled me. No small part of this discipleship has been repeating what he learned from Reeder or pointing me to ways he continued to learn from Reeder\u2019s ministry until his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/harry-reeder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent death<\/a>. This models a truth the psalmist proclaims: \u201cOne generation shall commend your works to another\u201d (Ps. 145:4).<\/p>\n<h3>Reeder\u2019s Influence on My Dad<\/h3>\n<p>Over the last few years, Dad and I have marveled at the many gifts God gave Reeder to use in service of the church. His faithful proclamation of the Bible every Sunday morning and evening blessed thousands. His heart for the lost and his ability to talk to anyone had him praying for countless waiters and waitresses. His sharp memory allowed him to move around effortlessly without notes in the pulpit. Reeder remembered the name of virtually everyone he met.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Reeder\u2014through his teaching, leadership, and even humor\u2014discipled my dad. My dad, in turn, discipled me. No small part of this discipleship has been repeating what he learned from Reeder.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As Reeder\u2019s ministry grew, his influence continued through his leadership conferences, retreats, books, and sermons. My dad reminisces about storming a hill in an impromptu Civil War reenactment during one of Reeder\u2019s leadership training trips. The prominent pastor-teacher wasn\u2019t afraid to have a little fun.<\/p>\n<p>My dad will also miss Reeder\u2019s funny quips. When speaking of how he began to value Christian education and a biblical worldview after surrendering his life to Christ, Reeder once declared, \u201cI actually found out my head could be used for something other than a baseball cap and a golf visor.\u201d My dad still repeats and chuckles at that phrase.<\/p>\n<h3>Passed Along to Me<\/h3>\n<p>Reeder\u2019s love for Jesus emanated through his relationships, especially his Spirit-empowered love for his wife, children, and grandchildren. I was blessed to be coached in soccer by Reeder\u2019s son-in-law and play at a summer camp with his grandson. Both witness well to God\u2019s glory in the secular sports world, and they\u2019d credit this to their father-in-law and grandfather\u2019s influence.<\/p>\n<p>Though Reeder moved from North Carolina to Alabama before I was born, my dad and others at Christ Covenant Church passed along their love for his teaching to me. The familiar opening and closing tune of Reeder\u2019s <em><a href=\"https:\/\/briarwood.org\/in-perspective\/home\/today-in-perspective\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Today In Perspective<\/a><\/em> podcast still rings in my head. Through this daily ministry, Reeder taught listeners how to approach politics and the news of the day from a gospel-centered perspective.<\/p>\n<p>Reeder thrived on emphatically communicating profound theological truths in simple ways. His resources gave me confidence to better understand the Bible and its intersection with faith and politics. His mantra \u201cTruth without love is barbarity, but love without truth is cruelty\u201d is ingrained in my mind. The slogan captures a sliver of who Reeder was. As a man committed to the truth of God\u2019s Word, he unashamedly proclaimed the good news of Jesus\u2019s life, death, and resurrection. Though unwilling to compromise biblical truth amid cultural pressures, Reeder wrapped the truth he preached in a shawl of love.<\/p>\n<p>Drawn to Reeder\u2019s preaching and his ministry at Briarwood Presbyterian in Birmingham, Alabama, I considered living there over the summer. My sister will be a freshman at Samford University in Birmingham in the fall, and she eagerly anticipated sitting under Reeder\u2019s teaching for the next four years. Though we were never part of his church, we\u2019ll miss him deeply.<\/p>\n<h3>Generation to Generation<\/h3>\n<p>Thirty years after my dad started there, our family still attends Christ Covenant Church. Through Reeder\u2019s love for Jesus and commitment to stay \u201con mission, on message, and in ministry,\u201d my dad has grown in steadfast love for Christ and his church. He loves our family well. He cherishes the evening service and fellowship with the saints. He treasures God\u2019s Word. Reeder\u2019s influence on my dad remains, and it won\u2019t soon be forgotten.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>His resources gave me confidence to better understand the Bible.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Psalm 78:4 says, \u201cTell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD.\u201d Reeder modeled what it means to proclaim God\u2019s glory to generation after generation. One day, if the Lord wills, I hope to tell the next generation stories about my dad. And there&#8217;ll be no way to share Dad\u2019s story without telling about that Christ-exalting preacher, Harry Reeder. I\u2019m one of the thousands who stand in his legacy, part of a new generation that has \u201cset their hope in God\u201d (Ps. 78:7).<\/p>\n<p>I want to live my life like Reeder lived his. By God\u2019s grace and in the Spirit\u2019s power, I want to be faithful, fun, and diligent in my declaration of Jesus\u2019s name to the people around me. Like Reeder, I want to teach the next generation of \u201cthe glorious deeds of the LORD.\u201d<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re hearing a lot these days about dechurching, deconstruction, and decline. Church attendance in America is dropping. Is this a crisis or merely a correction? Is it more of a problem or an opportunity? What can we expect for the future of the American church landscape?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m not a prophet or the son of a prophet (Amos 7:14), but I was asked recently to speak to some church leaders about that question. Here are six answers I proposed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>1. The church\u2019s future is certain.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amid much hand-wringing and prognostication, we must start with one absolutely certain truth: the church has a future. Our Lord Jesus Christ said so: &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it&#8221; (Matt. 16:18).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Jesus promised <\/span><em>he<\/em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will build his church, we should have profound optimism about the future. Yes, your local church (or mine) may fold, split, or shrink. Individual churches and denominations will rise and fall. But the church as a whole will thrive. Anytime you feel disheartened about what\u2019s happening in America, look at what God is doing in, say, the Global South, and be encouraged. Jesus is building his worldwide church, just as he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>2. The church\u2019s future is complicated.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Great-Dechurching-Leaving-Going-Bring\/dp\/0310147433\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to<\/a> Jim Davis and Michael Graham, about 15 percent of American adults have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/podcasts\/as-in-heaven\/dechurched-america-why-leave\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stopped attending church<\/a> in the past 25 years. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the Pew Research Center <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/religion\/2022\/09\/13\/modeling-the-future-of-religion-in-america\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">projects<\/a> that over the next 50 years, Americans who claim no religious affiliation at all (&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/pastors-know-about-nones\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nones<\/a>\u201d) will rise to between one-third and one-half of the population. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s sobering. But as you ponder headlines about declining church attendance and the growth of the Nones, consider these contrasting statistics:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/religion\/2022\/09\/13\/modeling-the-future-of-religion-in-america\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">64 percent<\/a> of Americans identify as Christian<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/religion\/2019\/10\/17\/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace\/\">43 percent<\/a> identify as Protestant<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/storylines.substack.com\/p\/the-coming-evangelical-christian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">35 percent<\/a> identify as evangelical\/born-again<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/storylines.substack.com\/p\/the-coming-evangelical-christian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Half<\/a> of black Americans identify as evangelical Christians<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latinos are the <a href=\"https:\/\/theworld.org\/stories\/2019-08-14\/megachurches-home-churches-podcasts-american-evangelicals-are-not-monolith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fastest-growing<\/a> evangelical population<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/short-reads\/2023\/05\/10\/most-us-parents-pass-along-their-religion-and-politics-to-their-children\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">80 percent<\/a> of teenagers with evangelical\/born-again parents also identify as such<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>Individual churches and denominations will rise and fall. But the church as a whole will thrive.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data suggests the future of the church is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/blogs\/trevin-wax\/church-stable-crisis-yes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">complicated<\/a><\/span><b>.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It won\u2019t be linear, monolithic, or predictable. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just look at what\u2019s happening in Christian higher education: in the past 12 months, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salemnews.com\/news\/gordon-conwell-announces-plan-to-sell-hamilton-campus\/article_1bfe494c-d2df-11ec-9add-17ea53cce723.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced plans<\/a> to sell its main campus<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Trinity International University <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eltrinity.com\/tiu-announces-plans-to-move-undergrad-program-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shuttered<\/a> its residential undergraduate programs<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and King&#8217;s College in Manhattan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/03\/17\/nyregion\/kings-college-manhattan-possible-closing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced<\/a> it may shut down too<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Yet simultaneously, seven major seminaries have seen <a href=\"https:\/\/intrust.org\/Magazine\/Issues\/Summer-2021\/What-makes-seminaries-grow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enrollment <em>growth<\/em><\/a> in each of the past five years<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Is Christian higher education dying or growing? Well, it\u2019s complicated. And so is the future of the church.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>3. The church\u2019s future is conservative.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2005, the United Church of Christ (UCC) became the first mainline Protestant denomination to officially embrace gay marriage. They expected this progressive stance to result in a growth boom. In 2006, with great optimism, the UCC announced the ambition to plant more than 1,600 new congregations by 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over that <a href=\"https:\/\/juicyecumenism.com\/2022\/07\/13\/ucc-shows-mainline-protestantisms-future-unrelenting-decline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15-year period<\/a>, however, the denomination\u2019s membership declined by more than 40 percent; 60 percent of its congregations now have fewer than 50 people; and in 2021 it sold its national headquarters to pay bills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This story shouldn&#8217;t surprise; it\u2019s the story of mainline Protestantism over the past 60 years. In 1960, the seven mainline denominations boasted 30 million members. Now they have 13 million. Writing at the Institute on Religion and Democracy, John Lomperis <a href=\"https:\/\/juicyecumenism.com\/2022\/07\/13\/ucc-shows-mainline-protestantisms-future-unrelenting-decline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">observes<\/a>, \u201cChurches that . . . reject clear biblical teaching on sexual morality can expect dramatic, long-term, and irreversible membership decline.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The numbers don\u2019t lie: theological liberalism leads to stagnation and decay. Whatever future the American church has, it&#8217;ll lie in the hands of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/20-quotes-thrill-orthodoxy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">those who embrace historic Christian orthodoxy<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>4. The church\u2019s future is contested.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Various factions are vying to define the American church&#8217;s future. The exvangelicals want a deconstructionist future. The metachurch enthusiasts want an online future. The culture warriors want a combative future. The wokesters want a progressive future. The nationalists want a Christendom future. And so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The numbers don\u2019t lie: theological liberalism leads to stagnation and decay.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And many of these people are in your church contending for their tribe&#8217;s future, like a family vacation where all the kids are fighting in the back seat.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way forward is to realize this is the new normal. American society is fragmented, and the future of the church is contested. The days of an \u201cevangelical consensus\u201d (if there ever was such a thing) are behind us. But rather than descend into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/tribe-without-tribalism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tribalism<\/a> and quarreling, we should make our case for the church\u2019s future boldly and charitably, showing love and good humor toward those who disagree. We should develop a habit of \u201ccorrecting [our] opponents with gentleness [so that] God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth\u201d (2 Tim. 2:24\u201325). We should be quick to admit our faults and failures, delighting in God\u2019s love for us in Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re going to lead in the church, you must be willing to fight for orthodoxy, purity, and gospel integrity. As Michael Graham <a href=\"https:\/\/mereorthodoxy.com\/one-year-later-reflecting-on-evangelicalisms-six-way-fracturing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">put it<\/a>, \u201cWe need non-anxious leaders who aren\u2019t afraid to be in a perpetual three-front war with the secular left, the secular right, and the world\/flesh\/Devil.\u201d In short, we need <a href=\"https:\/\/store.thegospelcoalition.org\/tgc\/products\/9417\/the-multi-directional-leader?_gl=1*18dlxr1*_ga*NTU2NjY3MTcwLjE2NzYwNTExNzY.*_ga_R61P3F5MSN*MTY4NDE2NjM0Mi4xMjUuMS4xNjg0MTY3NTA3LjYwLjAuMA..\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multi-directional leaders<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>5. The church\u2019s future is corporeal.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this year, I received a marketing email from a large Christian parachurch organization inviting me to a \u201cmetaverse church summit.\u201d As I researched the experts leading the summit, I recognized a man who&#8217;d been a church planter in my city; I&#8217;d sent a few folks his way to help him assemble a core team. He spent two years trying to plant a church, never achieved critical mass, and then ran out of money and shut down the church.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet here he was, leading a \u201cdigital church network.\u201d I\u2019m not exactly sure what that is, but the fact that a digital church movement is being led by someone who hasn\u2019t led an analog church shows the problem with this approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t believe the &#8220;metaverse church&#8221; hype. The future of the church is corporeal\u2014physical and embodied. After all, as social neuroscience expert Matthew Lieberman <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/why-we-are-wired-to-connect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has shown<\/a>, \u201cOur need to connect with other people is even more fundamental than our need for food or shelter.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We shouldn\u2019t need a scientist to tell us this; we learned it the hard way during the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Don\u2019t believe the &#8216;metaverse church&#8217; hype. The future of the church is corporeal\u2014physical and embodied.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us are familiar with Abraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. He taught that the most basic human needs are physiological; once those are met, we can \u201cascend the pyramid\u201d to address needs for safety, love and belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization. But according to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieberman, Maslow got one thing wrong. Mammals are born helpless and rely on social connections to get their physical needs met. Thus our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NNhk3owF7RQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most basic needs are social<\/a>, not physical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the metaverse is the massive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/disrupting-ourselves-death\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disrupter<\/a> some think it will be, it&#8217;ll never replace our need for embodied social connection.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>6. The church\u2019s future is countercultural.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The church in America has long been plagued by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/deconstruct-culture-not-faith\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">perils of enculturation<\/a>. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dynamics-Spiritual-Life-Evangelical-Theology\/dp\/0830852883\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the words<\/a> of Richard Lovelace,<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the church has not fully appropriated the life and redemptive benefits of Jesus Christ, . . . either it will suffer destructive enculturation, absorbing elements of its host cultures which it should discern and suppress as unholy, or . . . protective enculturation, fusing itself with certain aspects of Christianized culture until the gospel is thought to be indissolubly wedded to those cultural expressions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lovelace regards enculturation as a \u201crust\u201d forming on the church&#8217;s witness. To shake the rust loose, the gospel must be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dynamics-Spiritual-Life-Evangelical-Theology\/dp\/0830852883\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disenculturated<\/a>: \u201cDisenculturation . . . is vital to the church&#8217;s missionary expansion. . . . The gospel is free to become encultured\u2014to wear many forms of expressions like clothing when the need arises\u2014only when it has been disenculturated.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The future of the church, I pray, will be one where the church does the work of disenculturation so it becomes robustly countercultural. What we need are neither \u201crelevant\u201d churches (destructive enculturation) nor culture-war churches (protective enculturation). We need churches with joyful, thick, gospel countercultures that invite people into and embody a new way of life. Churches existing as a \u201ccity within the city\u201d\u2014or a small town!\u2014gracefully affirming what can be affirmed but opposing what should be opposed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some aspects of this future fill me with anticipation; others perplex and daunt me. But I draw strength from our starting truth: Jesus <\/span>will<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> build his church, and he\u2019s given us the joy of working alongside him. So let\u2019s get to work.<\/span><\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>On May 18, 1980, Mount Saint Helens erupted in the state of Washington. I know because I lived in Oregon, 75 miles south of the volcano, and I shoveled gray ash like hot snow out of our yard.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone knew the explosion was coming, but the eruption still killed dozens of people including a man named Harry Truman (not the president).<\/p>\n<p>Truman didn\u2019t have to die. He had every opportunity to survive. But he refused to believe the experts who said the volcano was dangerous. He refused to obey the governor who ordered him to evacuate. He loved the limelight\u2014local news outlets made him a hero for sticking it to the man. But when he was 83 years old, Mount Saint Helens had the last word. A deadly column of flaming gas consumed his property\u2014and him.<\/p>\n<p>They say Harry Truman was part of the greatest generation.<\/p>\n<p>Graduates, you&#8217;re part of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/gen-z\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Generation Z<\/a>. In just a few years, there will be more of you than any other generation\u2014a whopping 82 million. And you&#8217;ve faced unique struggles. The country is a mess\u2014politically, socially, economically\u2014and racially polarized. Your generation also bore the brunt of the pandemic with its forced isolation. No wonder Gen Z is afflicted with soaring rates of anxiety and depression.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the good news: your generation isn\u2019t worse or better than any other. Think back to Harry Truman. He may have been part of the &#8220;greatest generation,&#8221; but he still lived for himself, blinded by his own pride. After all, people are people in each generation. Think about Ecclesiastes 1:9: \u201cWhat has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To avoid repeating the mistakes of the foolish in every generation, here are five life lessons I believe will produce fruit in your life.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Remember Death<\/h3>\n<p>People don\u2019t like to think about death\u2014especially when life looks more like a starting line than a finish line. We don\u2019t like to post about death. Mentioning it is a great way to kill a conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, no matter how fast you try to run from it, death haunts every one of us. Pastor and author <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Remember-Death-Surprising-Living-Coalition\/dp\/1433560534\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matt McCullough<\/a> says each of us lives in death\u2019s shadow:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">It shows up in our insecurities about who we are and why we matter. It shows up in our dissatisfaction with the things we believe should make us happy. And it shows up in our pain over the loss of every good thing that doesn\u2019t last long enough.<\/p>\n<p>Death is natural, but it\u2019s not good. It\u2019s proof this world isn&#8217;t what it should be.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>No matter how fast you try to run from death, it haunts every one of us.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Even as you&#8217;re near the start of your life, the end of your life will come. Awareness of death sharpens the mind. It helps you focus on what&#8217;s most important. It humbles you\u2014you&#8217;re not God; you&#8217;re mortal. To dust you will return.<\/p>\n<p>How, then, can you remember death? Go to funerals. Spend time with the elderly. Join a church with people from every generation.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Marvel at Resurrection Life<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/podcasts\/gospelbound\/happened-molly-worthen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Molly Worthen<\/a> is a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After growing up in a secular home with no exposure to Christianity, she went to Yale and became intrigued by faith, earning a PhD in religion. Yet she primarily showed interest in Christianity the way a scientist shows interest in a rat\u2014poking, prodding, dissecting.<\/p>\n<p>One day, Worthen met Christians who surprised her. They sought to answer her questions, show her the beauty of God, and point her to the power of forgiveness found in Christ. She had so many reasons <em>not<\/em> to be a Christian. She didn\u2019t like what the Bible says about homosexuality and hell. She knew her colleagues in the history department would think she&#8217;d lost her mind if she became a Christian.<\/p>\n<p>But she couldn\u2019t get over this one glorious truth: if Jesus rose from the dead, he\u2019s the real deal. The resurrection eventually shattered her unbelief.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re about to start a new chapter in life. This is exciting! But nothing is more exciting than the empty tomb. If you&#8217;re a Christian, your faith will be tested in the days ahead. You&#8217;ll be confronted with questions you struggle to answer. But you have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/20-quotes-staying-christian-college\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">good reasons<\/a> from Scripture and from history to believe Jesus rose from the dead.<\/p>\n<p>How can you marvel at resurrection life? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/zombie-loves-church\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gather<\/a> with Christians every Sunday. Put yourself in a church that preaches the gospel of a crucified and risen Savior.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Put Down Your Phone<\/h3>\n<p>Your smartphone is like a vampire sucking the life out of you. For all the good of technology\u2014I appreciate the Find My Friends app and playing Wordle\u2014your phone is a monster from a horror movie that exists to destroy all goodness and happiness in your life.<\/p>\n<p>OK, I\u2019m being dramatic.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I do believe extended time on your phone increases jealousy, reduces contentment, and makes you think you aren\u2019t beautiful enough, smart enough, rich enough, or successful enough. Your phone pulls you away from actual people into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/scrolling-alone\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secret and tragic web of anonymous darkness and pain<\/a>. The way we use social media can hurt us, shorten our attention spans, and dull the beauty of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>How can you put down your phone? By putting down your phone. Stick it in a drawer. Keep it away from your bed. Delete your social media apps. Instead, gather with Christians at church. Meet up with real people with whom you can talk, who love you for who you are and don\u2019t tempt you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/podcasts\/recorded\/scrolling-alone\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">be someone you\u2019re not<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Pick Up God\u2019s Word<\/h3>\n<p>Psalm 119:105 says, \u201cYour word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.\u201d God has revealed himself in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/i-love-my-black-letter-bible\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">66 books of the Bible<\/a>. They&#8217;re his words, recorded by Spirit-guided men. Where Scripture speaks, God speaks.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Where Scripture speaks, God speaks.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Bible won&#8217;t teach you how to change a tire, but it will tell you to honor your parents who may help you change your tire. The Bible won&#8217;t teach you how to cook dinner, but it will tell you it\u2019s good to work with your hands and provide for yourself and your family. The Bible won&#8217;t teach you how to get hired by your dream company, but it will tell you how to live life for the glory of Christ. The Bible won&#8217;t tell you whom to marry, but it will tell you what to look for in a husband or a wife. The Bible won&#8217;t tell you how to get straight As in college, but it will tell you that your biggest problem isn&#8217;t a C but your sin\u2014and the only answer is the crucified and risen Christ.<\/p>\n<p>How can you pick up God\u2019s Word? Gather at a church where the Bible is preached\u2014where the point of the sermon is the point of a particular passage. Be around people who love the Bible and will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/read-bible-well\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">encourage you<\/a> to read it daily.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Run Hard After God<\/h3>\n<p>Leo Tolstoy wrote a short story titled \u201cHow Much Land Does a Man Need?\u201d A Russian peasant named Pahom manages to gain a little property, but he always wants a little more. One day, he sells his property and moves to a part of Russia rich with land for sale. A landlord makes an amazing offer: for 1,000 rubles, Pahom can have all the land he&#8217;s able to circumnavigate by foot in one day. That\u2019s the condition\u2014he must be back at the starting line before sunset or he forfeits his money and land.<\/p>\n<p>Pahom sets out on his journey, salivating over the prospect of a glorious new homestead. He runs and runs\u2014and when he thinks he should turn back, he runs forward even faster. \u201cJust a little more land,\u201d he tells himself. Finally, he turns around and sprints for the finish line, trying to beat the hot Russian sun to gain his prize.<\/p>\n<p>He collapses at the finish line just in time\u2014the land is his. But Pahom is dead; the trip killed him. \u201cHow much land does a man need?\u201d Tolstoy\u2019s answer is six feet\u2014just enough for a burial.<\/p>\n<p>Beware of turning something good into your god. There are many good things you can run after: education, a career, financial security, ministry, even a spouse. But if what is good becomes more important to you than God, it&#8217;ll leave you with nothing.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s my final bit of counsel as you start the next chapter of your life. Run hard after the God of the Bible. He\u2019s worth it! He&#8217;s the Creator; you&#8217;re the created. He&#8217;s the Master; you&#8217;re the servant. He&#8217;s the sun; you&#8217;re the planet orbiting his greatness. Live for anything or anyone else and you will die. Live for him, trusting in Christ crucified for sinners, and you will have life eternal.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Perhaps more than ever before, people are asking the question \u201cWhat does it mean to be a man (or to be a woman)?\u201d While many in society are unwilling to give a straightforward answer, some of us within conservative Christian circles jump to oversimplified definitions. I\u2019ve heard it a thousand times in a variety of versions: \u201cI tell my kids that girls grow up to be moms and boys grow up to be dads.\u201d While statements like that are correct in part, they&#8217;re incomplete\u2014and even misleading.<\/p>\n<p>Widely in Christian evangelical literature and teaching, we&#8217;ve defined gender (who men and women are) by focusing on <em>biological sex<\/em> (men and women&#8217;s physical differences) or <em>gender roles<\/em> (what men and women do functionally). In our desire to uphold the dignity and distinction of the genders, we&#8217;ve oversimplified our understanding. We&#8217;ve defined what it means to be a woman as merely being biologically female (physical) or being\/having the potential to be a wife, mother, and follower of male leadership (roles\/functions).<\/p>\n<p>I fully recognize biological sex and gender aren&#8217;t synonymous. In today&#8217;s culture, the two terms refer to different concepts. Biological sex references the binary physical difference between males and females observed in our bodies and DNA. Gender is typically used to reference cultural expressions of masculinity and femininity or a perceived &#8220;gender identity&#8221; along a spectrum of expression.<\/p>\n<p>But in God\u2019s good design for humanity, there&#8217;s a deep interconnection between the physical (body) and nonphysical (soul) aspects of us as embodied people. Both our physical and nonphysical aspects are gendered together. This means our genders are neither skin deep nor relegated to our minds. We&#8217;re gendered people, all the way down.<\/p>\n<h4>Why can\u2019t we define gender according to roles?<\/h4>\n<p>What it means to be men and women isn&#8217;t the same thing as the roles for men and women. The innate nature of men and women cannot be defined by functions. In fact, the roles defined in Scripture are descriptive, illustrative, limited, and temporary. Roles like prophet, priest, and king (in the Old Testament) and elder\/pastor and husband (in the New Testament) serve as temporary pointers to Christ and will ultimately be fulfilled in him.<\/p>\n<h4>What is the gender question really asking?<\/h4>\n<p>More than asking for role distinctions between men and women, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/5-books-gender-debates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the gender question<\/a> is fundamentally asking \u201cWhat does it mean to <em>be<\/em> human as a man (or as a woman)?\u201d We must answer the ontological question of our innate nature rather than our functions.<\/p>\n<h4>Which aspects are the same between men and women?<\/h4>\n<p>A survey of Scripture reveals many aspects of humankind\u2019s innate nature, most of which are the same for men and women. I&#8217;d summarize these shared aspects as our <i>purpose<\/i>, <i>mandate<\/i>, and <i>virtues<\/i>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The innate nature of men and women cannot be defined by functions.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>At creation, God clearly designed humanity in his image and as male and female (Gen. 1:26\u201327). Both males and females share the <i>purpose<\/i> of glorifying God as his image-bearers. They were also given the same <i>mandate<\/i> to multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it (v. 28). This mandate was expanded, though not replaced, by Jesus\u2019s command to go and make disciples of the nations (Matt. 28:18\u201320). Men and women clearly share the mandate to physically and spiritually multiply and fill the earth.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, all people share the same <i>virtues<\/i>, or qualities commanded by God and desirable for a fruitful life (e.g., fruit of the Spirit, spiritual giftings, the Beatitudes). Our shared virtues include any biblical characteristics that enhance or support the qualities of flourishing, such as wisdom (Prov. 1:1\u20137), courage (Josh. 1:9), and nurturing (Eph. 6:4). These virtues are faith-based and gender-indiscriminate; they&#8217;re demanded of and available to all believers.<\/p>\n<h4>Which aspects are distinct between men and women?<\/h4>\n<p>Yet God\u2019s design for people does include some clear distinctions between genders. These differences can be summarized as <i>type<\/i> and <i>expression<\/i>. God created two <i>types<\/i> (male and female) of one kind (humanity). God\u2019s intended distinction between the two types is evidenced by their distinct formations (Gen. 2:7, 21\u201322). Made in the same image, of the same kind, and of the same constitution, the man and the woman were formed separately. They&#8217;re not the same and aren&#8217;t interchangeable. Our biological differences signify\u2014but don&#8217;t epitomize\u2014this distinction of type because we&#8217;re more than our biology. Type includes both the physical and nonphysical aspects of who we are.<\/p>\n<p>The distinction of <i>expression<\/i> signifies that the perspective and method of living out the shared properties (purpose, mandate, and virtues) are often different for men and women.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, the various disciplines of science and philosophy have recognized men and women generally think and behave differently\u2014though successfully naming the differences has been consistently impossible. Male and female expression cannot be defined universally. Rather, gender-typical expression falls on a context-defined spectrum. That means typical behavior for men and women varies across time and cultures.<\/p>\n<p>While the spectrum of expression is broad, Scripture does provide clear guide rails. The scriptural limitations for the spectrum of gender expression seem to be the willful act to disregard one\u2019s gender in an effort to be seen as, or identified with, the other gender type (Deut. 22:5). God\u2019s apparent concern isn&#8217;t with defining female and male expression of the shared properties (purpose, mandate, and virtues). Rather, God\u2019s concern seems to be with a woman intentionally behaving as a man (or with a man intentionally behaving as a woman) in order to be identified as a man (or as a woman).<\/p>\n<p>The same principle would apply to those attempting to blur or hide the reality of their own gender (i.e., androgyny or gender fluidity). Whether or not her expression is typical for her context, a woman\u2019s gendered expression must reflect her creation as the female type and her acceptance of being a woman (and vice versa for a man). It\u2019s only within the context of expression that the discussion of roles and functions becomes relevant, as part of reflecting our gender includes accepting any gender-specific roles dictated in Scripture (whether in the home or in the church).<\/p>\n<p>To summarize, gender refers to the two <i>types<\/i> of humankind\u2014male and female\u2014who share <i>purpose<\/i>, <i>mandate<\/i>, and <i>virtues<\/i> but who differ in their <i>expression<\/i>. In God\u2019s design for humankind, the two types possess many uniformities and few distinctions and are complementary to each other.<\/p>\n<h4>Did you just use a spectrum to answer the gender question?<\/h4>\n<p>No. Let\u2019s be clear: gender is binary. There are only two types of humans\u2014male and female. But our expression of gender does fall on a spectrum. In every context, there are male-typical expressions of the shared properties. Every man in that context expresses his genderedness (maleness) along that spectrum of typical and nontypical behavior.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Let\u2019s be clear: gender is binary. But our expression of gender does fall on a spectrum.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For example, as believers we&#8217;re all called to gentleness as a fruit of the Spirit at work in our lives. Male-typical expression of gentleness in my context is characterized by being kind-hearted, quiet-natured, and even accommodating. By contrast, a nontypical male expression of gentleness might be physical affection, tenderness, and high emotional intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>Male-typical and female-typical expressions fall on two different spectrums. Therefore, there&#8217;d also be a separate spectrum for the female expression of the shared properties in every context. In both cases, the outer bounds of the spectrums are the willful intention of using nontypical expressions to be perceived as the opposite gender or to blur one\u2019s gender.<\/p>\n<h4>How do we explain gender to our kids?<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/3-things-tell-children-gender\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Explaining gender to our kids<\/a> has become increasingly difficult and controversial. Considering a definition grounded in innate nature, we should answer their questions with these starting points:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Being a man means living out your God-given purpose, mandate, and virtues as a man.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Being a woman means living out your God-given purpose, mandate, and virtues as a woman.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Then we ought to emphasize the following aspects as foundational to gender\u2014of course, adjusting the language for the child\u2019s age and understanding:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">When God made people, God made boys (men) and girls (women). God made only two types of people: boys and girls.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Boys and girls are the same in a lot of ways; both are equally special and important to God and to God\u2019s plan. God has given us the same purpose and the same commands to glorify him.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Boys and girls are different in some ways. Some of those differences are evident in your body. Our bodies point to some of the ways boys and girls are suited to help each other (complementarity).<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Boys and girls are different in some nonphysical ways. We often participate in God\u2019s plan in different ways\u2014how we worship God, how we follow God\u2019s instructions, or how we love each other.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><em>For older kids<\/em>: We can\u2019t define gender by what you do or what you like. Some behaviors and tendencies are typical for boys and girls, but they&#8217;re not the defining standards. For example, girls are typically more social and relational than boys their age. Not sharing some of the traits that are typical for your gender doesn&#8217;t mean you don\u2019t fit your gender. You&#8217;re still 100 percent a girl even if you like playing sports more than talking to your friends.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">God cares that you accept how he made you\u2014not that you act like all the other boys (or girls) around you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Though the differences in what men and women do are helpful visual clues for gender distinction, roles cannot sufficiently replace defining the innate nature of being a man or a woman. Similarly, our physical bodies point to our distinctions but don\u2019t define them.<\/p>\n<p>Whether we&#8217;re having conversations about gender with our colleagues or our kids, we need a better answer than anatomical differences and temporary job descriptions. Let\u2019s point them to God\u2019s good design, recognizing both the binarity and nuance of living as men and women in God\u2019s plan.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>When we recently moved to Washington, DC, there was one tourist attraction on the top of my list to visit: Arlington National Cemetery. Eighteen years ago when I went for the first time, it was an interesting historic place. But as I prepared for my second visit nearly two decades later, it was different.<\/p>\n<p>Now I have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/what-veteran-knows\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">friends buried there<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Visiting the Dead<\/h3>\n<p>I went alone with a dozen yellow roses from the grocery store. I walked through the visitor center, tears blurring my vision, and boarded a bus that would take me to the individual grave sites. I went to Mark\u2019s grave first, in Section 60. As I searched for his name, I recognized many others. At the military school I attended, students memorize the full names of hundreds of classmates. The names I recognized were my peers.<\/p>\n<p>From Mark\u2019s stone, I glanced up and saw the markers for two of my husband\u2019s friends, Doug and Megan. I only brought one bouquet, intending to lay three flowers at the four graves I came to visit. But now I wanted to place a flower at each name I recognized. I didn\u2019t bring nearly enough.<\/p>\n<p>I placed the first flower and stood there, staring at the white granite and a name etched so clearly. <i>Now what?<\/i> I bowed my head and waited. Only tears.<\/p>\n<h3>Praying for the Living<\/h3>\n<p><i>Do I pray?<\/i> This was a holy moment, and my desire was to cry out to the Lord. But who or what should I pray for? Not my fallen friends. We don\u2019t pray for the dead, only for the living. Should I pray for comfort for their families? Or that their deaths wouldn&#8217;t be in vain? Or that God would be glorified somehow? Spiritual angst intermingled with grief and confusion.<\/p>\n<p>Then relief swept over me as I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/lords-prayer-overcome-struggles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">remembered that Jesus told us how to pray<\/a>. So I prayed the Lord\u2019s Prayer (Matt. 6:9\u201313).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My desire was to cry out to the Lord. But who or what should I pray for? We don\u2019t pray for the dead, only the living.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>When we pray the Lord\u2019s Prayer in times of sorrow and suffering, we have a tendency to emphasize \u201cThy kingdom come.\u201d We cry out, <i>Deliver us from this sorrow and pain and confusion and just come already!<\/i><\/p>\n<p>But standing in the cemetery, the Holy Spirit led me to pray for myself, for the here and now. The bodies of these friends are in the ground. Their time is done. While we rightly take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/2-truths-grieving\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our grief<\/a> to the Lord and look forward to Christ\u2019s return, we must also remember that God is still at work today, on earth among the living.<\/p>\n<p><i>Thy will be done on earth\u2014and in me\u2014as it is in heaven<\/i>, I prayed over and over again. <i>Thy will be done on earth\u2014in me and through me. Use me how you will.<\/i><\/p>\n<h3>Instrument of God&#8217;s Will<\/h3>\n<p>As I walked down a hill at the end of my visit, I passed an area with older markers, gravestones in different shapes and sizes, with names and dates from the 19th century. The inscription on one stone in this military cemetery caught me off guard: \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers, for they will inherit the earth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It reminded me of the prayer, penned by Francis of Assisi, that we sang in my teen years at my high school in East Africa. When I pray <i>Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven<\/i>, this is my desire:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.<br \/>\nWhere there is hatred, let me sow love;<br \/>\nwhere there is injury, pardon;<br \/>\nwhere there is doubt, faith;<br \/>\nwhere there is despair, hope;<br \/>\nwhere there is darkness, light;<br \/>\nand where there is sadness, joy.<br \/>\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek<br \/>\nto be consoled as to console;<br \/>\nto be understood as to understand;<br \/>\nto be loved as to love.<br \/>\nFor it is in giving that we receive;<br \/>\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned;<br \/>\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Amen <\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are over 400,000 graves in Arlington National Cemetery. And unless Christ returns first, I may be buried there as well. These were real people who led full lives. As we remember their sacrifice and lament the reality and tragedy of death, we can rightly look forward in hope to Christ\u2019s triumphant return.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While we rightly look forward to Christ\u2019s return, we must also remember that God is still at work today, on earth among the living.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But let\u2019s not forget that as long as we have breath, God isn&#8217;t done with us. While those who died in Christ now bear witness to God\u2019s will being done in heaven, we still have the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/lords-prayer-lived\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">opportunity to participate in his will<\/a> being done on earth.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll return to Arlington with my husband and children. We&#8217;ll tell stories of our friends. It&#8217;s my privilege to honor their families by remembering. And we&#8217;ll pray as the Lord taught us to pray, saying, \u201cOur Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>When Christians evangelize, they call their hearers to trust Jesus for salvation. The problem is, almost every word in \u201ctrust Jesus for your salvation\u201d is liable to be misunderstood by Western secular people today.<\/p>\n<p><i>Trust<\/i>\u2014It\u2019s for the gullible.<\/p>\n<p><i>Jesus<\/i>\u2014We can\u2019t be sure what he said, and he existed so long ago that he\u2019s irrelevant.<\/p>\n<p><i>Your<\/i>\u2014If there&#8217;s something out there called salvation, it certainly isn\u2019t for me. Don\u2019t presume to tell me what I need.<\/p>\n<p><i>Salvation<\/i>\u2014This life is all there is, so it makes no sense to be \u201csaved\u201d from it. Also, \u201csalvation\u201d raises the dangerous specter of fundamentalism.<\/p>\n<p>Where does that leave us? The message of trusting Christ for our salvation isn\u2019t just rejected today: it\u2019s excoriated. Many people think our evangelism peddles an oppressive ideology that preys on the vulnerable, manipulates the weak, and privileges the self-righteous and entitled. \u201cThe church protects and covers up pedophiles and bullies who exploit vulnerable churchgoers, so don\u2019t talk to me about trusting their hateful god.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other people laugh at our evangelism as if it were equivalent to a plea to sign up for Melanesian frog worship (yes, that&#8217;s a thing). That&#8217;s quite a hill of anger and prejudice to climb, humanly speaking. Good news, then, that God is the God of the impossible (Mark 10:27).<\/p>\n<p>As if this wasn\u2019t enough, we must also continue to evangelize believers. In the West today, few new people are entering the church through the front door, and increasing numbers are leaving through the back. Both groups need gospel-ing.<\/p>\n<p>A large part of our challenge today is to get the real Jesus in front both of those in the church and those outside. Here are three ways we might, by God\u2019s grace, do just that.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Cultivate a biblical social imaginary.<\/h4>\n<p>One contemporary phenomenon contributing both to the dechurching of Christians and to unbelievers\u2019 resistance to the Christian message is that modern culture vigorously and effectively catechizes us every day from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep.<\/p>\n<p>This cultural catechesis comes in both subliminal and explicit ways, through our institutions, our entertainment, and our work. It\u2019s cultivated in what&#8217;s seen, measured, and rewarded in society. We\u2019re shaped to inhabit the world with particular expectations, hopes, dreams, and fears.<\/p>\n<p>If churches, Christian friendship groups, and Christian families don\u2019t provide countercatechesis and a thick community rhythmed and patterned by different influences, then our assumptions, dreams, and lives will remain resolutely secular in their formation, even if we spout biblical verities on a Sunday morning.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If churches, Christian friendship groups, and Christian families don\u2019t provide a countercatechesis, then our assumptions, dreams, and lives will remain resolutely secular in their formation, even if we spout biblical verities on a Sunday morning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s a desperate need to disciple Christians at the level of what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Secular-Age-Charles-Taylor\/dp\/0674986911\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Charles Taylor<\/a> and others call the &#8220;social imaginary,&#8221; and to model and explain to unbelievers how the Bible shapes more than our worldview\u2014more than our ideas\u2014but also our dreams, affections, and habits in healthy, robust, rich, and subtle ways of its own. Our approach will change in different contexts, but a Christian social imaginary will include cultivating a vision of discipleship that accomplishes two crucial tasks.<\/p>\n<p>First, a biblical social imaginary will help Christians to appreciate how the world is aggressively catechizing us and what sort of fears, dreams, assumptions, and hopes we&#8217;re being nudged toward. If Christians have no idea how thoroughly and effectively worldly catechesis shapes us, we can do precious little about it. After all, the most effective propaganda is making people believe the status quo cannot be changed but is simply \u201cthe way things are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Second, cultivating a biblical social imaginary will help Christians, together in community, to develop countercatechetical habits of thought, speech, and behavior that are deep enough to present a different rhythm and pattern of life to that of the world. These things can\u2019t just be learned on an intellectual level; they need communities (church, friendship groups, families) where they\u2019re regularly, repeatedly, and intentionally lived out. Otherwise, the world will be on video, but Jesus will be on audio.<\/p>\n<p>As Christians cultivate a biblical social imaginary, we&#8217;ll grow to be deeply, deliciously, and destabilizingly different from the unbelievers around us, just as the New Testament authors expected (Matt. 5:16; John 13:35; 1 Pet. 2:12; 3:15).<\/p>\n<h4>2. Understand the gospel as both the antithesis and the fulfillment of the culture\u2019s aspirations.<\/h4>\n<p>As Christians present Christ to the culture, we typically fall into using one of two playbooks. Some adopt a stance of antithesis, assuming that whatever the culture stands for, the church must stand against; whatever the culture values, the church must vilify. The second stance, sometimes adopted in reaction to the first, is to present the gospel as the linear fulfillment of the culture\u2019s existing aspirations. Both approaches sell the Bible short and leave the culture cold.<\/p>\n<p>In 1 Corinthians 1, a dazzling passage full of cultural insight, Paul shows us a better way. He is clear that the gospel is the antithesis of the ambient cultural values: \u201cWe preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles\u201d (v. 23, NIV). But he\u2019s equally clear the gospel is the ultimate fulfillment of these values: \u201cThe foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength\u201d (v. 25, NIV).<\/p>\n<p>What are the modern equivalents of the \u201cwisdom\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d Paul saw valued so dearly in the cultures around him? Much has been written on this important topic (see, for example, Daniel Strange\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Making-Faith-Magnetic-Culture-Talking\/dp\/178498650X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Making Faith Magnetic<\/i><\/a> and Rebecca McLaughlin\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Secular-Creed-Engaging-Contemporary-Claims\/dp\/0999284304\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>The Secular Creed<\/i><\/a>); here are some quick ideas. Justice and freedom are perhaps two of the main late-modern shibboleths, but also consider sanctuary (read the astonishing afterword to Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier\/dp\/1541758005\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism<\/i><\/a>: it\u2019s a powerful apologetic for the deep psychological and social importance of sanctuary); forgiveness (social media never forgives, never forgets); and the riotous priority of gift and grace in a biblical social imaginary over the calculative modern paradigm of the market, merit, and competition. In each of these areas, God\u2019s message has both challenge and comfort for weary modern souls.<\/p>\n<p>This model of combining antithesis and fulfillment\u2014or what contemporary cultural apologist Daniel Strange calls \u201csubversive fulfillment\u201d\u2014is set out for us in perhaps the greatest work of public theology and cultural engagement in the 2,000-year history of the church: Augustine\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/City-Penguin-Classics-Augustine-Hippo\/dp\/0140448942\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>City of God<\/i><\/a>. His masterpiece stands as an exemplary model of this Pauline mode of commending the gospel to a hostile culture.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Help Christians to exult in, and live out, this gospel-shaped life.<\/h4>\n<p>This nuanced, Pauline stance toward modern culture isn\u2019t just biblical; it\u2019s exhilarating. To discover the rhythms and patterns of a distinctively biblical social imaginary, to feel the challenge and sweetness of how the Bible subversively fulfills modern society\u2019s deepest longings and assuages its deepest fears, is time and again an invitation to marvel at \u201cthe depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God\u201d (Rom. 11:33). The wall between \u201cpraise\u201d and \u201cevangelism\u201d thins. As C. S. Lewis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Reflections-Psalms-C-S-Lewis\/dp\/0062565486\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">notes<\/a>, we praise what we enjoy, and if Christians enjoy God with our time, treasure, and talents, with the rhythms and patterns of our lives, then we&#8217;ll surely declare his excellencies to those around us (1 Pet. 2:9).<\/p>\n<p>The truths of Christianity scratch the places where modern people itch. Making Christians more aware of these wonderful biblical truths and their beauty and potency for evangelism today would, under God\u2019s sovereignty, be a small piece of the grand jigsaw puzzle of helping our neighbors trust Jesus for their salvation.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The truths of Christianity scratch the places where modern people itch.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Does following these three encouragements mean we stop preaching \u201cJesus Christ and him crucified\u201d (1 Cor. 2:2)? By no means! That message provides Paul with his astonishingly incisive cultural critique. But it does mean that, like the Paul of 1 Corinthians 1, as we preach the weak and foolish cross we also engage the surrounding culture\u2019s dominant values, showing how \u201cthe foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength\u201d (1 Cor. 1:25, NIV).<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Have you ever felt discouraged and weary, worn down by the constant news cycle and the seeming pointlessness of daily life? Me too. Humans since the garden have often lacked confidence when facing the future. Knowing this, the Lord provided his Old Testament saints with the Feast of Weeks (Lev. 23:15\u201322), an old covenant celebration designed to remind Israel of the sure and certain harvest their kind God prepared for them.<\/p>\n<p>Even in 2023, amid the chaos of the late modern world, in spite of what the endless drip of news ledes may tempt us to believe, God&#8217;s people still <em>can<\/em> live with confidence. Ancient Israel&#8217;s agricultural custom, with its description buried deep in Old Testament law, signals everything we need to know: A harvest will fill the barn. The feast announces this for our joy.<\/p>\n<h3>Features of the Feast<\/h3>\n<p>Chapter 23 is an essential section of Leviticus. It outlines \u201cthe appointed feasts\u201d (v. 2). These festivals served as a framework for Israel\u2019s life as God\u2019s people. On a weekly and annual basis, Israel would move their minds, souls, and bodies to rhythms of God\u2019s grace and provision. These rhythms would shape them, again and again, in the confidence that comes from knowing the Lord.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A harvest will fill the barn. The feast announces this for our joy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Feast of Weeks is one example, one rhythm that held out joy for God\u2019s people. It has four important features.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Pilgrimage to Jerusalem<\/h4>\n<p>The Feast of Weeks required able-bodied Israelites to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to worship in the temple. Their offerings were to be hand-delivered (Deut. 16:10).<\/p>\n<p>The worshiper would gather with others from places far and wide. Lest provincial concerns lead to distraction and discouragement, the Israelite would see and remember that God\u2019s abundant provision knows no geographic bounds. The north and south, the east and west, small villages and larger towns are all locations of God\u2019s faithful work for his people. As the Old Testament narrative marches on, we pick up hints that God\u2019s promises would spill beyond Israel\u2014the prophets foretold all nations would one day flow to the temple mount to join the party (Isa. 2:2).<\/p>\n<h4>2. Offerings<\/h4>\n<p>The Israelites were to bring grain and animals with wine as acts of worship. The varied offerings mixed themes of devotion, gratitude, forgiveness, and spiritual reconciliation (Lev. 23:16\u201320).<\/p>\n<p>Worshipers would remember the Lord is the Giver; all we possess belongs to him and comes from him. He is the true sustainer of our lives. Our labors of tilling, planting, weeding, tending, and harvesting aren&#8217;t the real source of our blessing. God made this clear for the worshiper in rich and deep ways. God dealt with each person\u2019s sin and shortcomings forthrightly, offering each person the forgiveness and freedom necessary to live in the light of joy instead of the darkness of guilt and shame.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Rest<\/h4>\n<p>The feast day was simultaneously a day to keep Sabbath (v. 21). Because the pilgrim dwelled in Jerusalem for the duration of the feast, there was no scramble back to the fields for personal self-making. Instead, the worshipers would trust that the Lord upholds the world even while they rested and worshiped.<\/p>\n<p>The ancient Israelites may not have felt the intense pressure we do to check emails on our days off or to overload the weeks after vacation to catch up, but in their own ways, our forefathers in faith were tempted to trust in self-provision. It was unnecessary then and now. The Feast of Weeks reminded them the Lord reigns.<\/p>\n<h4>4. Generosity<\/h4>\n<p>As they loaded their carts for the journey, worshipers would be reminded the edges of their fields were for others (v. 22). God\u2019s gracious gifts were to be shared with those whose circumstances were different. The biblical logic is that a generous God has a generous people.<\/p>\n<p>The Feast of Weeks was about joyful confidence in God, a confidence that couldn\u2019t be shaken or set aside by circumstances, by sin and shame, or by personal striving.<\/p>\n<p>We have a greater reason to be confident.<\/p>\n<h3>How Jesus Fulfills the Feast<\/h3>\n<p>The Lord Jesus speaks of himself as a grain of wheat (John 12:24). He sends workers into his plentiful harvest. He makes atonement as a perfect offering for sin and shame. He gives peace with God, and he, in his very person, assures us our God will most certainly give us all things (Rom. 8:32). Our crucified, risen, ascended, and returning Lord Jesus is always working in the world by the power of his Spirit, gathering a harvest of worshipers from every tongue and tribe and nation.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Feast of Weeks was about joyful confidence in God that couldn\u2019t be shaken by circumstances, sin and shame, or personal striving.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The outpouring of the Spirit in Acts 2 on the Day of Pentecost\u2014the celebration of the Feast of Weeks during the apostles\u2019 time\u2014sprouts up in the soil of the biblical narrative as a fulfillment of the prophets\u2019 promise that all nations will come to Jerusalem. The Spirit fills the cup of Old Testament imagery to the brim as Isaiah\u2019s dream is fulfilled. The Spirit preaches the gospel to worshipers from every corner of the Jewish diaspora, giving them the ability to hear and proclaim the good news to all people.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8216;Harvest Will Fill the Barn&#8217;<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cWhen we work well, a Sabbath mood \/ Rests on our day, and finds it good,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/commongood.cc\/reader\/whatever-is-foreseen-in-joy-by-wendell-berry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes<\/a> Wendell Berry. Here\u2019s the full context:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Whatever is foreseen in joy<br \/>\nMust be lived out from day to day.<br \/>\nVision held open in the dark<br \/>\nBy our ten thousand days of work.<br \/>\nHarvest will fill the barn; for that<br \/>\nThe hand must ache, the face must sweat.<br \/>\nAnd yet no leaf or grain is filled<br \/>\nBy work of ours; the field is tilled<br \/>\nAnd left to grace. That we may reap,<br \/>\nGreat work is done while we\u2019re asleep.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">When we work well, a Sabbath mood<br \/>\nRests on our day, and finds it good.<\/p>\n<p>Our labors to sow and plant, water and reap in the ordinary things of daily life are caught up in something bigger than the despair and violence we see on the news and in social media posts. Our Lord is always working. A great harvest is coming in. The barn will be filled full. Praise God! A Christian can live with confidence.<\/p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>The sacrifices we celebrate on holidays like Memorial Day have become increasingly incomprehensible in the secular West. Why would anyone sacrifice his life for something beyond himself? It makes little sense if death is final and absolute. In a materialist world, to die is naturally feared above all things, and anything mortally risky\u2014however chivalrous or dutiful\u2014is deemed foolish.<\/p>\n<p>Honoring sacrifice <em>does<\/em> makes sense in the context of belief in eternal life, however. If we believe the creedal words \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/catechism-inspired-song\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I am not my own<\/a>\u201d and that there <i>is <\/i>life beyond this life, then what is it to die? To be cut down in the prime of life in service of some cause (even a questionable cause) may still be undesirable, but it becomes more tolerable, or even honorable.<\/p>\n<p>Humans can suppress, but never quite escape, our God-given knowledge that there&#8217;s something more than this life. Perhaps that\u2019s why mainstream audiences are so stirred by war movies that depict soldiers in the line of duty, willing to courageously pay the ultimate price. They capture the beautiful valor and \u201cinto the fray\u201d grit that comes more naturally when we anchor our lives in truths and hopes beyond this world.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, I\u2019ve compiled a list of my favorite war films released in the last 50 years. I\u2019ve listed the movies below\u2014which represent nine different wars\u2014in chronological order of when the events they depict took place. Though my selections are no doubt informed by my American nationality, the themes they explore are universal and needn\u2019t be viewed only through a patriotic lens. Pick a few you haven\u2019t seen and add them to your viewing queue. Enjoy!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4><i>The Last of the Mohicans <\/i>(French and Indian War)<\/h4>\n<p>Michael Mann\u2019s 1992 epic, loosely based on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Last-Mohicans-Bantam-Classics\/dp\/0553213296\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s novel<\/a>, may be melodramatic at times, but it\u2019s the sort of sweeping wartime romance Hollywood doesn\u2019t make anymore.

The bill, LB 574, bans abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for medical emergencies, sexual assault, or incest, and restricts so-called gender-affirming care for transgender minors younger than 19.<\/p>\n<p>The law defines &#8220;gender-altering procedures&#8221; as any medical or surgical service and prescribed drugs related to gender alteration. The state&#8217;s chief medical officer, appointed by Nebraska\u2019s Republican governor, is also given the power to regulate nonsurgical gender-altering procedures for minors, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy.<\/p>\n<p>In Texas, a <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/wireStory\/texas-legislature-oks-ban-gender-affirming-care-minors-99414649\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">similar bill<\/a> headed to Governor Greg Abbott would make Texas the largest state to ban such procedures for minors. The bill cleared the GOP-controlled legislature over the objections of Democrats.<\/p>\n<h4>What is \u2018gender-affirming care\u2019?<\/h4>\n<p>The term \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d is a euphemism for the range of medical interventions provided to both children and adults to conform to the ideology of transgender identity.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/opa.hhs.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2022-03\/gender-affirming-care-young-people-march-2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Biden administration defines it<\/a> as a \u201csupportive form of healthcare\u201d that \u201cconsists of an array of services that may include medical, surgical, mental health, and non-medical services for transgender and nonbinary people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The government also claims, \u201cFor transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents, early gender-affirming care is crucial to overall health and well-being as it allows the child or adolescent to focus on social transitions and can increase their confidence while navigating the healthcare system.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Despite the misinformation presented on the topic, such medical interventions are neither evidence-based nor necessary for the mental and physical health of human beings. Children are often asked to make decisions that will affect their bodies and fertility before they are developmentally capable. Any concerns about the potential for regret in the future or the irreversible nature of some gender-affirming procedures are waved away by LGBT+ advocates as being unimportant or trivial. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/investigates\/special-report\/usa-transyouth-outcomes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reuters<\/a> found in a special investigative report, &#8220;Hard evidence on long-term outcomes for the rising numbers of people who received gender treatment as minors is very weak.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While the evidence against such interventions is ignored in the United States, many countries in Europe are still hesitant about experimenting on the bodies of children. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/briefing\/2023\/04\/05\/the-evidence-to-support-medicalised-gender-transitions-in-adolescents-is-worryingly-weak?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&amp;utm_source=google&amp;ppccampaignID=17210591673&amp;ppcadID=&amp;utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&amp;utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyLGjBhDKARIsAFRNgW9XnZxk6uze_sOg1X9NDjVw6lRhbC5A7yBaqvcIfMinZS7ZdGvSF-caAp3vEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Economist<\/em> notes<\/a>,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Almost all America\u2019s medical authorities support gender-affirming care. But those in Britain, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden, while supporting talking therapy as a first step, have misgivings about the pharmacological and surgical elements of the treatment. A Finnish review, published in 2020, concluded that gender reassignment in children is \u201cexperimental\u201d and that treatment should seldom proceed beyond talking therapy. Swedish authorities found that the risks of physical interventions \u201ccurrently outweigh the possible benefits\u201d and should only be offered in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d. In Britain a review led by Hilary Cass, a pediatrician, found that gender-affirming care had developed without \u201csome of the normal quality controls that are typically applied when new or innovative treatments are introduced\u201d. In 2022 France\u2019s National Academy of Medicine advised doctors to proceed with drugs and surgery only with \u201cgreat medical caution\u201d and \u201cthe greatest reserve\u201d.<\/p>\n<h4>What medical procedures are classified as \u2018gender-affirming care\u2019?<\/h4>\n<p>Gender intervention procedures are based on three categories: puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Puberty-blockers.<\/strong> The medications most commonly used to suppress puberty are known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/gender-dysphoria\/in-depth\/pubertal-blockers\/art-20459075\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)<\/a> analogues. GnRH analogues suppress the body&#8217;s release of sex hormones, including testosterone and estrogen, during puberty. These sex hormones affect primary sex characteristics (the sexual organs present at birth, including the penis, scrotum, and testicles and the uterus, ovaries, and vagina), and secondary sex characteristics (the physical changes in the body that typically appear during puberty, such as breast development and growth of facial hair).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hormone therapy.<\/strong> Treatments that lead to the development of certain secondary sex characteristics. Depending on what the person is trying to achieve, they might include anti-androgens, estrogens, progestogens, or testosterone. According to <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/briefing\/2023\/04\/05\/the-evidence-to-support-medicalised-gender-transitions-in-adolescents-is-worryingly-weak?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&amp;utm_source=google&amp;ppccampaignID=17210591673&amp;ppcadID=&amp;utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&amp;utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyLGjBhDKARIsAFRNgW9XnZxk6uze_sOg1X9NDjVw6lRhbC5A7yBaqvcIfMinZS7ZdGvSF-caAp3vEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Economist<\/a><\/em>, data suggests around 5,000 teenagers were prescribed puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones in America in 2021, which is double the number from 2017.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Surgeries.<\/strong> Surgical procedures are attempts to change the person\u2019s body to more closely match the body of someone of the opposite sex. This may include chest and genital surgeries, body sculpting, facial feminization, and hair removal, among other treatments. Currently, few states allow surgeries for children younger than 16.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Genital surgery.<\/em> A range of procedures are used to remove the genitals and reproductive organs to change the bodies people were born with. (\u201cBottom surgery\u201d is slang for genital surgery.)<\/li>\n<li><em>Chest surgery.<\/em> Surgery to remove or construct a person\u2019s chest, either removing the breasts (for women and girls) or breast augmentation (for men trying to look like women). (\u201cTop surgery\u201d is slang for gender-affirming chest surgery.) As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yalemedicine.org\/news\/transgender-guide-terms-you-can-learn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yale Medical points out<\/a>, one surgical procedure used to masculinize the chest\u2014called a bilateral mastectomy\u2014involves removing most of a person\u2019s breast tissue, accompanied by chest contouring. This is often offered to teens at the age of 16.<\/li>\n<li><em>Facial surgery.<\/em> For a man trying to look like a woman, treatments may include Adam\u2019s apple reduction and procedures to reshape the nose or other areas of the face. Surgeries for a woman trying to look like a man might include jaw augmentation or enhancement of the Adam\u2019s apple.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some treatment options are potentially reversible (e.g., puberty-suppressing hormone treatment can be stopped before other hormones are given), while others are semipermanent or fully permanent (like hormone treatment and surgical interventions).<\/p>\n<h4>Which states currently ban such procedures for minors?<\/h4>\n<p>The states that restrict or ban such interventions on minors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/best-states\/articles\/2023-03-30\/what-is-gender-affirming-care-and-which-states-have-restricted-it-in-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">include<\/a> the following: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the laws being enacted are facing legal challenges and may be struck down as unconstitutional.<\/p>\n<h4>What should Christians do on this issue?<\/h4>\n<p>Unlike many culture war issues in America, this issue is likely to be largely resolved in the next 10 to 15 years. By then, the results of today&#8217;s harrowing experiment on children\u2019s bodies will be widely seen by the public. Adults who were pushed to mutilate their bodies to conform to an ideological agenda will begin to express their regret and anger and will want\u2014and deserve\u2014to hold someone accountable for their pain and loss.<\/p>\n<p>One way we might bring that future into the present is to adopt an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.4029tv.com\/article\/arkansas-house-sends-governor-trans-care-malpractice-bill\/43260489\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">approach taken in Arkansas<\/a>. Lawmakers in that state are trying to make it easier to file malpractice lawsuits against doctors who provide such care. The law allows someone who received gender-transition medical interventions as a minor to file a malpractice lawsuit against his or her doctor for up to 15 years after the patient turns 18. (The current ban prohibits doctors from providing gender-confirming hormone therapy or puberty blockers to anyone younger than 18 or referring him or her to other doctors who can provide that care. No gender-affirming surgery is performed on minors in Arkansas.)<\/p>\n<p>This right to sue should be expanded to include lawsuits against medical associations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, who have misrepresented, ignored, and suppressed the evidence showing the harms of gender interventions in children. Many physicians who provide \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d to minors claim, without sufficient evidence, that the rate of those who regret such interventions is extremely low. But if they&#8217;re held accountable by being financially responsible for their medical malpractice, they might reconsider their willingness to prioritize LGBT+ ideology over medical science.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s a very good word.<\/p>\n<p>When a young man awakens to love and begins to pursue time alone with a young woman, &#8220;alone&#8221; is a very good word. I&#8217;ll never forget the evening Kim and I both stayed at a friend&#8217;s parents&#8217; house. We stayed up long after everyone else retired to their rooms. We sat on the floor and talked. We weren&#8217;t even dating yet. But we enjoyed a one-on-one conversation.<\/p>\n<p>From that point on, I sought alone time with Kim. She was my focus. Alone. Getting to know each other.<\/p>\n<p><em>Aloneness equals discovery.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Weddings are known for gathering numerous people to celebrate and witness the joining of two lives into a union. While surrounded by the masses, the new couple longs to be alone. Finally, the wedding ends. Away. Alone. Secluded.<\/p>\n<p><em>Aloneness equals oneness.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Eventually, children are born, bills await payment, and responsibilities grow. Diapers. Clambering. Demanding attention. More diapers. Parents are worn out. A couple ends their days asleep on the couch with hopes for an eventual date night to get away and be . . . alone.<\/p>\n<p><em>Aloneness equals survival.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Children grow into teenagers, young adults. A new existence being established. Independence desired. Feeling their way. The dance of give and take begins\u2014an artful skill. Parental responsibility grows in significance. The stakes are higher. And work or church or community opportunities and responsibilities increase. Varied quadrants seek your wisdom and availability. Couples long for time for each other.<\/p>\n<p><em>Aloneness equals sanity.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Graduation. Empty nest. Alone at last. Over the days, weeks, months, years, and decades the momentum builds; at every turn you&#8217;re seeking to be alone. And now aloneness arrives. I recall our last trip alone to Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and Grand Teton National Park for our 35th anniversary with great joy.<\/p>\n<p><em>Aloneness equals reward.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Blisteringly Alone<\/h3>\n<p>In 2019, Kim unexpectedly collapsed and died. We&#8217;d been married for 35 years.<\/p>\n<p>When death visits uninvited, you\u2019re alone in a very different way. As the Preacher observes,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is <em>alone<\/em>. . . . A threefold cord is not quickly broken. (Eccl. 4:9\u201310, 12)<\/p>\n<p>How can one word be both blissful and blistering? And just when you&#8217;re discovering the definition of blissful aloneness, the ultimate bait and switch is pulled off\u2014the bliss tauntingly exchanged for blisters. Blistering aloneness. Death\u2014and the resulting grief and loss\u2014introduces you to a new type of aloneness.<\/p>\n<p>Once you clawed for some alone time as a couple. Now you&#8217;d give anything to escape the isolation.<\/p>\n<p>Alone. One word; two very different meanings. A taunting play on a word.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>One word; two very different meanings. A taunting play on a word.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Grieving friend, there&#8217;s only one way to face the taunting nature of loss and the loneliness that accompanies it. The deep love of Jesus is unchanging. As Robert Grant wrote in his hymn \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/hymnary.org\/text\/o_worship_the_king_all_glorious_above\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">O Worship the King<\/a>,\u201d Jesus is our \u201cMaker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!\u201d He is our companion, and he never leaves us nor forsakes us (Heb. 13:5). In the deep, deep love of Jesus, you can experience \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/hymnary.org\/text\/o_the_deep_deep_love_of_jesus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an ocean vast of blessing . . . a haven sweet of rest<\/a>.\u201d You can experience his unwavering presence and love.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Isn\u2019t the Christian faith just a Western, white man\u2019s religion? Don\u2019t Christians suppress natural human desires for authenticity and replace them with a colonialist, heteronormative, and narrow vision of sexuality? Isn\u2019t Christianity an oppressive belief system?<\/p>\n<p>I studied in the U.S. and the U.K. before spending four years in pastoral ministry at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.covenantcitychurch.id\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Covenant City Church<\/a> in Jakarta, Indonesia. At the tail end of 2021, I returned to the States to take up a teaching post at <a href=\"https:\/\/rts.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reformed Theological Seminary<\/a> When I arrived, I was intrigued by this new line of objections against the Christian faith. The objections weren\u2019t of the same sort I encountered here a decade ago. They were also different from those I heard in my home city of Jakarta.<\/p>\n<p>Several realities I experienced in Indonesia can speak to the objections Western people raise about the faith. Learning from the global church helps believers in the West zoom out, put aside their assumptions, and see afresh the relevance and power of truths that may no longer seem relevant and powerful. Consider these four realities from Jakarta.<\/p>\n<h3>Religious Pluralism<\/h3>\n<p>Indonesia is a remarkably diverse nation with many faiths, and the city of Jakarta is a melting pot of different religions. Growing up, I attended a Christian school, celebrated the breaking of fasts with Muslim friends during Ramadan, and visited temples recreationally in Bali.<\/p>\n<p>While Indonesia is majority Muslim, with only 9 to 13 percent of citizens professing Christianity, the country\u2019s constitution explicitly recognizes six major religions as legitimate. Further, that percentage of the population equals 28\u00ad to 30 million Christians, a number larger than the entire population of Australia.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Learning from the global church helps believers in the West zoom out, put aside their assumptions, and see afresh the relevance and power of truths that may no longer seem relevant and powerful.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the West, there\u2019s growing skepticism about theism and the Christian faith, but that\u2019s not the case in Jakarta. One would be hard-pressed to find a convinced atheist or materialist, and the people who profess secular worldviews are those who have been educated in or worked in the West.<\/p>\n<p>Religion is pervasive. Our primary challenge was explaining why the Christian message is the <em>only<\/em> way to salvation. Jakarta has long been a center of world trade. It\u2019s a financial center with an educated population, but for most in that culture, common sense dictates there are many gods, many ways of salvation. What does this say about naturalist and materialist presuppositions in the West? Are they as common as many believe?<\/p>\n<h3>Porous and Enchanted Worldview<\/h3>\n<p>Jakartan life, to use Charles Taylor\u2019s term, is porous in every way. People have an enchanted view of the world, one where spiritual forces cross into and shape everyday life.<\/p>\n<p>Opening a business often means inviting both Catholic priests and Muslim imams to (at different times) bless the work and protect the business from malicious spirits. Couples often celebrate multiple wedding ceremonies, one to appease the Catholic side of the family and another to appease the Buddhist side. In Jakarta, unwanted circumstances are often attributed to curses, fate, or the wrath of a deceased ancestor. Parents advise their children not to associate with certain people due to a fortune teller\u2019s warnings, and you\u2019ll rarely find unlucky numbers like 4 or 13 marking the floors of a building. Pilgrimages to Mecca or ancestors\u2019 tombs are encouraged. Even the most secular often retain these supernatural beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>When I first read Augustine\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/City-Penguin-Classics-Augustine-Hippo\/dp\/0140448942\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>City of God<\/em><\/a>, I was struck by the similarity between the polytheistic Greco-Roman world he describes and Jakarta\u2019s porous society. While ministering in Jakarta has unique challenges, its legends, pilgrimages, rites, and loyalties parallel the society the gospel first encountered. Christians in that world were charged as \u201catheists\u201d because they argued God cannot be manipulated by earthly works and circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>In Jakarta, we preached that no pilgrimage, rite, or magic word can make us clean and that we shouldn\u2019t overanalyze life\u2019s circumstances thinking they contain secret supernatural messages. We preached that God can only be known in Christ and his Scriptures, not through intermediaries, prophets, or signs. We taught the Creator-creature distinction and showed from the Bible that God cannot be correlated with any immediate physical location. The Christianity we preached, while rooted in creedal and confessional orthodoxy, wasn&#8217;t seen as older or traditional but as remarkably progressive.<\/p>\n<h3>Sexual Ethics in a Culture of Shame and Taboo<\/h3>\n<p>In Jakarta, Christianity\u2019s sexual ethic isn\u2019t considered controversial. Rather, it\u2019s seen as a strength. Muslims are thankful Christians believe premarital sex is a sin, that marriage is for a man and a woman, and that gender is rooted in creation. Confucianists are glad to see the Bible honors the family. The Bible\u2019s sexual ethic is considered obvious and in accordance with natural law.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say no one experiences same-sex attraction, or that no one is having sex outside of marriage, but these Jakartans recognize they&#8217;re going against the grain, and converts to the Christian faith are clear God is concerned with how they ought to live sexually.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In Jakarta, we preached that no pilgrimage, rite, or magic word can make us clean and that we shouldn\u2019t overanalyze life\u2019s circumstances thinking they contain secret supernatural messages.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>When I returned to the States, I was surprised to hear Christianity decried as a \u201cwhite, heteronormative, and cisgender\u201d religion meant to suppress human nature\u2019s natural instincts. Far from it. What&#8217;s perceived as \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cWestern\u201d in Jakarta isn&#8217;t Christianity\u2019s sexual ethic but rather secularism\u2019s promiscuity and transgender ideology. Those in the U.S. who disagree with Christianity\u2019s sexual values are also implicitly saying Indonesian society is backward, in the dark, and needs to be \u201cenlightened\u201d or Westernized.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, Jakartans are more likely to share Christianity\u2019s sexual ethic, but they feel a great sense of guilt and shame when they fall short of societal expectations. They see extramarital sex not merely as wrong but as taboo. Promiscuity brings shame to both self and family.<\/p>\n<p>To those who experience social guilt and shame, Christianity announces a better way. It calls sin by name, depends on Christ\u2019s blood for absolute cleansing, and calls sinners to be made new in him. Our church welcomed those who struggled yet who were committed to confessing sin and living in accordance with biblical teaching. We welcomed those who chose to be open about their struggles rather than hide in shame. In the Indonesian context, the temptation is to capitulate to cultural expectations and be harsher. But sinners found the church could be a forgiving community because of the forgiveness won by Christ\u2019s blood.<\/p>\n<h3>Family, Tradition, and Authority<\/h3>\n<p>Indonesians have an understanding of reasoning and authority based in an oral tradition passed down from one generation to another, usually by the eldest living family member. This is a <em>person<\/em>-centered view of authority, not by merit but by age and place in the family. (Or rather, age is the main criterion for merit.)<\/p>\n<p>The view of family we encountered in Jakarta was normally that of a single, growing family across time. Marriages weren\u2019t understood as creating a new family but as extending the family, and a family\u2019s eldest members had responsibility for this large family. They continually made efforts to provide for their children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren.<\/p>\n<p>In the Indonesian context, a person&#8217;s identity isn&#8217;t found primarily in his or her interior psychological life. As my father often said, \u201cFollowing your passion is a Western man\u2019s luxury and is usually a sure path to bankruptcy.\u201d The prevalent Western view that happiness and identity are found by following one\u2019s passions and sexual feelings is an unprovable and parochial assumption. Jakartans instead define identity with respect to family lineage and one&#8217;s place within that family. A person follows the religion of the family, and there\u2019s often an expectation he or she should marry a member of the same race and culture to propagate the family\u2019s identity.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>To those who experience social guilt and shame, Christianity announces a better way. It calls sin by name, depends on Christ\u2019s blood for absolute cleansing, and calls sinners to be made new in him.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Christian faith challenges both Indonesia\u2019s family-centered view of identity and the Western psychologically centered view of identity. As Larry Hurtado <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Destroyer-gods-Early-Christian-Distinctiveness\/dp\/1481304747\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has shown<\/a>, rather than an epistemology centered on individuals or familial tradition, Christians are called not to fear the traditions of men but to follow God and his will as disclosed in the Scriptures.<\/p>\n<p>In Jakarta, Christianity can be viewed as a threat to the cohesion of one\u2019s family identity and relations. After all, Christians are called to leave family idols and to follow the one true God exclusively. They must view their unity in Christ as more precious and deeper than mere blood relations. For this reason, it was important for us at Covenant City Church to engage with controversial issues by teaching the permissibility and beauty of both intermarriage across racial bounds and friendships between Chinese Indonesians and native Indonesians (a historically ruptured relationship), and what honoring your elders and children looks like in Christ.<\/p>\n<p>As a post-Christian society advances in the States and beyond, we do well to listen to global contexts like Jakarta. They show us that the objections and challenges that seem self-evident and universal in the West are more contingent and contextualized than we immediately see. The Christian faith, after all, is neither Western nor Eastern but cosmic, having to do with the God of the universe who became incarnate in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. They encourage us to have confidence the cosmic gospel will continue to do its work all over the world.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>It\u2019s not easy to initiate gospel conversations in a secular age. Perhaps unhurried interactions in your life are rare, or the relational vibe isn\u2019t conducive to serious moments, or we fall into conversational ruts that make the thought of going <em>there<\/em> seem painfully awkward.<\/p>\n<p>But what if the reasons for our silence go deeper?<\/p>\n<p>One way to become reinvigorated for a task is to reflect on what keeps us from doing it in the first place. Here, then, are three common reasons we keep quiet.<\/p>\n<h4>1. We ignore our context.<\/h4>\n<p>In a post-Christian age, we can\u2019t presume any basic assumptions in those we\u2019re trying to reach with the gospel. So we must take care to lean in and listen well, to climb into our neighbor\u2019s way of seeing and inhabiting the world. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be speaking about terms\u2014even biblical ones\u2014that\u2019ll be simply misunderstood or rejected outright.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cGod loves you\u201d is great news, but meaningless if you don\u2019t understand the nature of God (or for that matter, love).<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou are a sinner\u201d is true, but meaningless if you don\u2019t know what sin is or don\u2019t feel that badly about it.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou need a Savior\u201d is true, but meaningless if you don\u2019t grasp what you need to be saved from.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThe Bible says . . .\u201d is great, unless the Bible is considered an archaic, patriarchal collection of fairy tales.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When it comes to the gospel, we don\u2019t need to dress it up to make it cool. We need to break it down to make it clear. <em>That<\/em> is the purpose of studying your surrounding culture in light of God\u2019s Word. What are people\u2019s prevailing values, hopes, and fears? How does the gospel story both fulfill their deepest longings and subvert their most cherished idols?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When it comes to the gospel, we don\u2019t need to dress it up to make it cool. We need to break it down to make it clear.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To be effective in our cultural moment, then, <a href=\"https:\/\/au.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/asking-better-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we must excel at asking questions<\/a>. If your main goal in evangelism is to hear yourself talk, especially with highfalutin biblical jargon, then many skeptics will walk\u2014or run\u2014away confused (at best). But if your goal is to be effective, then listen in order to understand, speak in order to be understood, and respectfully engage your neighbor\u2014a fellow image-bearer\u2014with the best news he&#8217;ll ever hear.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, you\u2019ll just be adding static to the air.<\/p>\n<h4>2. We fail to love.<\/h4>\n<p>Writing to the Thessalonians, the apostle Paul said, \u201cWe cared so much for you that we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us\u201d (1 Thess. 2:8, CSB).<\/p>\n<p>Loving the lost isn&#8217;t simply a spiritual virtue. It makes practical sense too\u2014because where love isn&#8217;t felt, the message is unlikely to be heard. Trust is essential, and it\u2019s downstream from a sense that you care. Failing to love won\u2019t only hinder your own efforts to impart the gospel\u2014it may also harden your listener&#8217;s heart toward Christians in general and make the task harder for the next believer who witnesses to her.<\/p>\n<p>But loving the lost must never be limited to the category of practical strategy\u2014indeed, it&#8217;s the healthiest litmus test of whether <em>you<\/em> know the God you profess. In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul asserts,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">If I speak human or angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give away all my possessions, and if I give over my body in order to boast but do not have love, I gain nothing. (vv. 1\u20133, CSB)<\/p>\n<p>You may be the most consistent evangelist in the world. You may even see conversions. But <em>if you lack love<\/em>\u2014don\u2019t miss this\u2014you&#8217;re \u201ca noisy gong . . . nothing . . . gain[ing] nothing.\u201d The risks, and the stakes, couldn&#8217;t be higher.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most concrete ways to love well is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/quick-to-listen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">listen well<\/a>. That\u2019s not just good advice for struggling romances; it\u2019s Emotional Intelligence 101. Being listened to is so close to being loved that most people cannot tell the difference. No wonder Scripture exhorts us to be \u201cquick to listen, slow to speak\u201d (James 1:19, CSB). How often, though, do we reverse this and risk turning people off to the voice of God because we\u2019re too in love with our own?<\/p>\n<p>We need to speak to others as if we remember what it was like to be lost too. In an age of outrage, a countercultural message will not be compelling without a countercultural tone.<\/p>\n<h4>3. We bow to fear.<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that one of the main reasons we shrink back from witnessing is because we\u2019re afraid. Perhaps it\u2019s the fear of an awkward interaction, or the fear of outright rejection or embarrassment, or the fear of being unequipped\u2014lacking a ready answer for a skeptic\u2019s objection. The list goes on.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We need to speak to others as if we remember what it was like to be lost too.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Some of our fears may feel wimpy, but they&#8217;re real. Only God knows how many gospel opportunities I&#8217;ve squandered due to a fear that froze me in my tracks.<\/p>\n<p>But evangelism isn&#8217;t complicated: if we wait to share our faith until our fears have completely evaporated, we&#8217;ll never share it. And don\u2019t wait for the \u201cperfect\u201d scenario either\u2014it\u2019ll never come. Just resolve to seize, and steward, the one God has given you.<\/p>\n<p>And when the moment arrives\u2014suddenly, you sense, you could redirect the conversation to spiritual things\u2014you may feel physically miserable. Pit in your stomach? That\u2019s normal. Racing heart? Normal again. Shaky voice? Welcome to evangelism. But these unpleasant feelings aren&#8217;t a signal to escape, to postpone, to kick the can down the road with a resigned sigh of \u201cNext time.\u201d No, this is the moment to face the fear head on and put it in its place: \u201cYes, Fear, you&#8217;re real and powerful\u2014but you&#8217;re not omnipotent. You&#8217;re not my king. I don\u2019t answer to you; I answer to King Jesus. I\u2019m going to lean on him and take a step of faith.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Imagine\u2014especially if you didn\u2019t grow up in a Christian home\u2014if the person who first spoke the gospel to you had instead been frozen by fear. What if he&#8217;d concluded, <em>No, Lord, not me! I\u2019m still not equipped, still not ready. Plus, the environment isn\u2019t ideal.<\/em> Where might you be today?<\/p>\n<p>In Luke 12, Jesus exhorts his disciples not to be anxious, since their heavenly Father is simultaneously great and good. Then he utters one of the most beautiful statements in all the Gospels: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, little flock, because your Father delights to give you the kingdom\u201d (v. 32).<\/p>\n<p>Did you catch it? Shepherd. Father. King. One tiny verse, three massive truths. The God we meet on the pages of Scripture\u2014and only that God\u2014is the Shepherd who seeks us, the Father who adopts us, and the King who loves us.<\/p>\n<p>And 2,000 years ago, in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Shepherd King became the Lamb slain. As comforting as it is to hear \u201cthe LORD is my shepherd\u201d (Ps. 23:1), there\u2019s an even better promise: the Lamb is my shepherd (Rev. 7:17). And before he ascended to glory, he left us with this indomitable assurance: \u201cRemember, I am with you always, to the end of the age\u201d (Matt. 28:20, CSB).<\/p>\n<p>You may be afraid in evangelism, but you&#8217;ll never be alone.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent public debate between British Muslim polemicist Zakir Hussain and American Christian author Michael Brown helpfully illustrates the two most common Islamic approaches to the Bible. On the one hand, Muslims will often argue that the Bible predicts the coming of Muhammad. On the other hand, they will often undermine the Bible&#8217;s accuracy and authority.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Hussain claimed Moses\u2019s mention in Deuteronomy 18:15 of a future prophet to come was a prophecy about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/9-things-about-muhammad\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Muhammad<\/a>. But when Brown carefully demonstrated that according to the verse the prophet would need to come from Israel (\u201cA prophet like me from among your own people,\u201d NRSV), the direction of the debate shifted. At that point, Hussain asserted the Masoretic Text had added the Hebrew word for \u201cfrom your midst\u201d to the verse, even specifying that the word wasn\u2019t to be found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The debate, accessible on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x06nQkltp4o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brown\u2019s YouTube channel<\/a>, points to the remarkable efforts some Muslims make to search the Bible\u2019s text for claims about their messenger while casting doubt on the text when its content doesn\u2019t agree with Islamic dogma. It also shows how, when all arguments fail, Muslims typically fall back on their accusation that the Bible is corrupt and falsified.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, the debate exemplifies the necessity for Christians to know the Bible well and candidly declare its truths.<\/p>\n<h3>Corrupted Gospel?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making a case for the reliability and authority of the Word of God with Muslims is always worthwhile. This is especially true of the New Testament and, within it, the Gospel accounts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditionally, Muslim accusations against the Bible have been the main line of attack against accepting the deity and redemptive death of Jesus. If Muslims are to converse with Christians about such basic gospel truths, many will demand \u201cproofs\u201d the New Testament Gospel accounts match the book they call the <em>Injil<\/em> (a book that Muslims claim was \u201csent down\u201d upon &#8216;Isa, the Qur\u2019anic Jesus).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Most Muslims know very little about the Bible and its contents, yet typically they\u2019re familiar from childhood with several lines of accusation against it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most Muslims know little about the Bible and its contents, yet typically they\u2019re familiar from childhood with several lines of accusation against it. They\u2019ve been told by parents and mosque leaders that the Bible was allowed to become corrupt by its custodians at some point in the past or that it was actively falsified for a variety of reasons. Throughout Islamic history, the main accusation of falsification has been that Jews and Christians changed or erased references to the messenger of Islam allegedly found in the \u201coriginal\u201d Torah and Gospel.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why will some Muslims go to such great efforts, even learning Hebrew and Greek, to cast doubt on the biblical text? It\u2019s because the Bible bears witness to Jesus, not to the messenger of Islam.<\/p>\n<h3>Counter Claims<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muslim accusations against the Bible can be meaningfully countered. The best context in which to respond to accusations is one-on-one within a personal relationship. Written apologetics and public dialogue can be effective and helpful. However, better than a merely defensive response to Muslim accusations is a proactive and positive presentation of the reliability and authority of the Bible in Muslim terms. To do this, Christians should familiarize themselves with the best <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/099399721X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">scholarly resources<\/a> and learn to tailor that information to the points Muslims are likely to raise.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, they should be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/course\/evidence-for-the-reliability-of-the-gospels\/#the-gospels-and-eyewitness-testimony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prepared to address<\/a> issues related to manuscripts, transmission, and the claim of abrogation. Contrary to the expectations of many in the West, Muslims generally respect principled, straightforward Christian expressions of support for the Bible and its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Jesus-Eyewitnesses-Gospels-Eyewitness-Testimony-dp-0802874312\/dp\/0802874312\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">witness to Jesus<\/a>, even if at the same time they repudiate the truth of those expressions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also useful, though less common, is an appeal to Muslims for dialog on a level scholarly playing field. Muslim polemicists love to use statements from academic biblical studies that they believe support Muslim accusations of corruption or falsification of the Bible. Rarely will Muslims mention\u2014or even admit into the conversation\u2014academic scholarship that raises the same kinds of questions about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/reviews\/concise-guide-quran-what-christians-ayman-ibrahim\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the text of the Qur\u2019an<\/a>. A recent example of this kind of scholarship is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Creating-Quran-Shoemaker\/dp\/0520389034\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Creating the Qur\u2019an<\/em><\/a> by University of Oregon professor Stephen Shoemaker. He shows that uncertainties surrounding ancient manuscripts are in fact a challenge Christians and Muslims share.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But beyond apologetics, the most fruitful avenue toward Jesus for Muslims is <a href=\"https:\/\/au.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/introducing-the-gospel-to-a-muslim\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Word of God itself<\/a>. Many testimonies of Christians from Muslim backgrounds will highlight how their reading of the Bible and their personal encounters with the Jesus to whom the Bible bears witness were influential in their coming to faith in Christ. There are no substitutes for the Jesus of Scripture, the spiritual power of the gospel (Rom. 1:16), and the effective work of the Word of God (Heb. 4:12).<\/p>\n<h3>Point to Christ<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Brown\u2019s debate with Hussain, the Muslim polemicist claimed the prophet spoken of in Deuteronomy 18:15 was the messenger of Islam. When faced with a firm and appropriate answer, however, he switched to accusing Jews of corrupting the verse in the Masoretic Text. In his alert response, Brown noted correctly that Deuteronomy 18:15 isn\u2019t found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Meanwhile, he showed the Hebrew term for \u201cfrom among their brothers\u201d three verses later in Deuteronomy 18:18\u2014which is attested to in the Scrolls\u2014carries the same basic meaning as the expression disputed by the polemicist from the Masoretic Text.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Beyond apologetics, the most fruitful avenue toward Jesus for Muslims is the Word of God itself.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But more significant than Brown\u2019s ready knowledge of manuscripts was his forthright proclamation of the fulfillment of Deuteronomic prophecy in Peter\u2019s sermon from Acts 3. There, not only does the prophet emphatically come from Israel (3:22), but Jesus is confirmed as the One in whom the prophecy is fulfilled (3:20), precluding all later claims.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is precisely the goal of the Christian endeavor in this important field: we support the reliability and authority of the biblical witness to Christ so Muslims can meet Jesus. Apart from Jesus, no one can come to God the Father. Apart from Jesus, no one can enjoy the forgiveness of sin, no one can \u201chave life\u201d (1 John 5:12). We desire our Muslim friends to experience these blessings.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p><b>I have a hard time correcting and being stern with my employees. What should my tone and delivery look like?<\/b><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Giving correction and feedback is always challenging, particularly in the workplace as you&#8217;re tasked with overseeing different personalities. As a newer supervisor, this is one of the areas where I&#8217;ve had to grow the most.<\/p>\n<p>Every work environment has conflict to be managed, work to be improved on, and deadlines to be met. If you have employees under your supervision, you&#8217;re bound to have to correct behaviors, shepherd work performance, and enforce agency policies. This isn&#8217;t an easy task, but God through his Word has given us a pattern we can imitate in our workplaces and with the people we supervise.<\/p>\n<p>The events of Genesis 2 and 3\u2014Adam and Eve&#8217;s work in the garden, their fall into sin, and God&#8217;s correction of them\u2014are about more than simply a worker in the wrong, but they do model helpful principles we can apply in our own workplaces.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Start with clear expectations.<\/h4>\n<p>In Genesis 2, the Lord placed man in the garden. In the first work assignment given to humanity, God set the expectations of the work to be done. Adam was supposed to be in the garden to work it, watch over it, and name the animals God created.<\/p>\n<p>Even though Adam was without sin, God didn&#8217;t assume he had an innate understanding of his job description or performance requirements. God outlined the work for Adam, set the boundaries of his work, and explained the behaviors that wouldn&#8217;t be tolerated\u2014as well as the consequences: \u201cThe LORD God commanded the man, saying, &#8216;You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die\u201d (Gen. 2:16\u201317)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Even though Adam was without sin, God didn&#8217;t assume he had an innate understanding of his job description or performance requirements.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We should imitate this in our workplace by explaining to our employees the duties, expectations of employment, prohibited behaviors, consequences, and methods of evaluation. Provide this in writing and request employees sign an acknowledgment of these expectations to be placed in their performance files.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what this could look like:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Employees must arrive at work promptly at 8:00 a.m. There&#8217;s a 5-minute grace period. Employees who arrive at 8:06 a.m. or after will be considered late. A pattern of tardiness will be addressed and reflected in the employee\u2019s evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>Most workplaces have established codes of conduct, job descriptions, and procedures to follow if standards aren&#8217;t met. Use these with current employees, and make it part of your onboarding process. When expectations have been clearly established, you&#8217;ll be able to correct more effectively.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Address problems as they occur.<\/h4>\n<p>As we continue to read through humanity&#8217;s first work assignment, we encounter the first failed performance evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>Adam and Eve listened to the serpent\u2019s taunting (\u201cDid God really say?\u201d), and they succumbed to temptation. They didn&#8217;t follow the command given to them by the Lord. They didn&#8217;t meet expectations, and they sinned by eating the forbidden fruit.<\/p>\n<p>God didn&#8217;t let Adam and Eve experience the consequences of their sin without addressing them directly. He didn&#8217;t wait until they sinned more to address their compounded failure or wait until they approached him before addressing their sin. Instead, he came immediately and directly to them.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Be gentle in your tone.<b><\/b><\/h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m always amazed at the way God came to address Adam and Eve. He didn&#8217;t come accusing them of their failures or telling them they&#8217;d done it all wrong. He approached them gently, and when Adam and Eve heard him coming, they hid. So he asked them, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d (Gen. 3:9).<\/p>\n<p>We have so much to learn from our Lord. He already knew Adam and Eve\u2019s failures, but he started the conversation with an open question about their current position.<\/p>\n<p>As we bring correction to our employees, we should do the same. We may already know her quarterly report is due and she hasn&#8217;t submitted it, but instead of coming with an accusing tone, we can approach with a question: \u201cHow are you doing with that quarterly report?\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>4. Follow through with consequences.<\/h4>\n<p>The next verses tell us about Adam and Eve\u2019s begrudging admission of their failures and highlight their reluctance to take responsibility for their actions. The two are quick to shift the blame, make excuses, and claim ignorance.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>God didn\u2019t come accusing them of their failures or telling them they\u2019d done it all wrong. He approached them gently.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Even though they tried to avoid the consequences of their sin, God had already set clear expectations, boundaries, and consequences for their actions. He didn&#8217;t engage in a power struggle with them. He didn&#8217;t try to argue about why they were in the wrong. He simply explained the direct consequences of their actions and gave them new directives about how to move forward with the work he&#8217;d given them (vv. 14\u201319).<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, failure to complete assigned tasks has consequences in the workplace. An employer must apply the consequences and give new directives to move forward with the pending work.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Imitate our Savior.<\/h4>\n<p>Dealing with underperformance, failure to do work, or inappropriate behavior in the workplace is frustrating. We can be tempted to respond with anger, raise our voices, and be harsh in implementing consequences with our employees. Here again, the Lord gives us a model to follow. He shows grace to sinners and mercy to the undeserving. He corrects us in order to attract us to him in love.<\/p>\n<p>In the same manner, you can bring gentle and firm corrections to your employees by having a foundation of set expectations. Your words can be kind while they address the issues at hand. Your actions can show grace while executing discipline and correction. And your life can be a witness to the gospel as you do this with love and grace.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>I thought I understood culture until I moved abroad and went grocery shopping in Asia. I couldn\u2019t read any labels, so I was painstakingly selecting each item, relying on pictures and translation apps. Suddenly, an elderly woman came over, pulled a bottle of dish soap out of my shopping cart, and spoke rapid Chinese as she wagged her finger at me. She put my selected soap back on the shelf, picked up a different brand, and put it in my cart.<\/p>\n<p>I was speechless and indignant. <i>What in the world? How dare someone invade my privacy and replace an item in my shopping cart?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Now that I\u2019ve been in Asia for more than six years, I better understand what was going on\u2014not only with the elderly woman but also in my own soul. Culture is like the proverbial iceberg. We may think we understand our culture, but much of it remains below the surface. We might not see it until someone crashes into our subconscious cultural beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, culture affects obvious things like what food we eat, where we live, and the types of clothing we wear. But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/deconstruct-culture-not-faith\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">culture goes much deeper<\/a> than that. It influences how we think and interact in a multitude of ways. That\u2019s why we need to consider how our culture might interfere with our call to be imitators of Jesus (1 Pet. 2:21). Sometimes we think we\u2019re acting in Christlikeness when we\u2019re really acting in culture-likeness.<\/p>\n<h3>Different Perspectives<\/h3>\n<p>Let me explain what was likely going on in my grocery store encounter. Asian cultures are collectivist. While Western cultures prioritize individualism, Asian cultures prioritize caring for the community. The woman was trying to be a good community member by helping me buy the best product for my needs. She had probably tried the soap I was planning to buy and knew it was lower quality. I didn\u2019t speak her language, so she was sharing her wisdom with me in the only way she could.<\/p>\n<p>But what about my heart? Why was I so angry about someone trying to help me? Just as the woman\u2019s culture influenced her to reach into my shopping cart, my culture affected my response. I\u2019m an American, a descendant of generations of trailblazers. My ancestors had to be independent self-starters or they wouldn\u2019t have survived. The culture I\u2019ve inherited prizes independence and self-sufficiency. So I felt intruded upon and my sinful heart easily turned to anger when someone else touched my shopping cart.<\/p>\n<h3>Different Focus<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to think our entrenched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/sermon\/christianity-and-culture-part-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cultural ideas<\/a> are right and godly. And indeed, some of our cultural traits are good, true, and biblical\u2014but not all of them are. Sometimes we dress up our cultural beliefs in Christian language or focus on certain parts of Scripture that align with our views. Each culture can demonstrate both the glory of God and the fallenness of mankind. We as believers are responsible to discern which cultural traits are godly and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/video\/fighting-lies-culture-tells-us-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which are sinful<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Each culture can demonstrate both the glory of God and the fallenness of mankind.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For example, collectivist Asian cultures emphasize conflict-free communication. This cultural norm tends toward indirect communication or sometimes even gossip. Eastern believers may focus on how the Bible calls us to be gracious to one another, so they&#8217;ll be hesitant to follow the approach of Matthew 18:15\u201317.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, Western (especially American) cultural communication can be so direct that we may forget we\u2019re supposed to communicate with truth <em>and<\/em> grace. We value justice and believe we must right all wrongs. That means we sometimes miss opportunities to overlook an offense, which Scripture describes as our glory (Prov. 19:11).<\/p>\n<p>Being an American living in Asia has helped me see that I tend to stand on my rights even though Christ modeled giving up his rights (Phil. 2:3\u20138). I shouldn&#8217;t insist on being independent and self-sufficient when God calls us to live in unified community (Rom. 12:4\u201318), submit to one another in love (Eph. 5:21), and depend on Christ (John 15:5). But I\u2019ve also seen God use my cultural traits for good; my American sense of independence took me to live in another culture in the first place.<\/p>\n<h3>See the Difference<\/h3>\n<p>The goal isn\u2019t to shed our cultural perspectives entirely but to learn to distinguish our cultural tendencies from biblical truths. Two practices have been helpful in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>First, when something provokes us, we need to slow down and consider if it might be our culture that has been offended. What does Scripture\u2014the whole of Scripture\u2014say about the situation? Are our cultural tendencies blinding us to any scriptural commands?<\/p>\n<p>Second, we need friends from other cultures. We need to have deep conversations with people who have different norms and perspectives. We need to have our cultural toes stepped on and be ready to see that our cultural traits may not always be godly.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The goal is to learn to distinguish our cultural tendencies from biblical truths.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As citizens of a heavenly kingdom, we can embrace whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable, and excellent about our cultures (Phil. 4:8) while also asking the Lord to help us see and replace ungodly aspects where they&#8217;re present in our lives. By God\u2019s grace, we&#8217;ll not only come to better understand our culture-likeness but we&#8217;ll also grow in Christlikeness.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Donald Macleod passed away in Edinburgh, Scotland, on May 21, 2023 at the age of 82. Over the past six decades, he was acknowledged as one of Scotland\u2019s preeminent theologians and cultural commentators. For many Scottish believers, he was also their beloved teacher.<\/p>\n<p>Macleod was born into a working-class, Gaelic-speaking home on the Isle of Lewis off the west coast of Scotland in 1940. He left the island to study at the University of Glasgow and then the Free Church College in Edinburgh. At the age of 22, he was ordained as the minister of Kilmallie Free Church of Scotland in the Scottish Highlands. In 1970, he moved to Glasgow to serve as the pastor at Partick Highland Free Church, where he typically preached six times a week in either English or Gaelic. Toward the end of the 1970s, he was called to Edinburgh to serve at the Free Church College (now Edinburgh Theological Seminary) as professor of systematic theology, where he&#8217;d eventually take on the role of principal in 1999. He remained on the faculty full-time until 2011 and continued to teach there for years after.<\/p>\n<h3>Influential Theologian<\/h3>\n<p>As a theologian, Macleod was known for his retrieval of historic Scottish Reformed theology and his outspoken defense of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/westminster-confession-faith\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Westminster Confession of Faith<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Macleod was known for his retrieval of historic Scottish Reformed theology and his outspoken defense of the Westminster Confession of Faith.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>His greatest theological obsession, however, was the cross of Christ and the love of God displayed therein.

I owe it everything, and all that remains now is to see it from within the veil.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Macleod\u2019s most lasting influence came through the classroom, where he taught virtually every prospective Free Church minister for decades. So widespread was his influence that by 2011, his son could write that only three Free Church ministers serving at the time hadn&#8217;t studied with him.<\/p>\n<h3>Outspoken Journalist<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to his work as a theologian, Macleod established a reputation as an outstanding journalist. In his festschrift <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Peoples-Theologian-Writings-Honour-Macleod\/dp\/1845505840\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The People\u2019s Theologian<\/em><\/a>, Brian Wilson\u2014a journalist and former minister in the Tony Blair government\u2014remarked that Macleod was \u201cby far the most literate and stimulating columnist writing in the Scottish press.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That work began in 1977 when Macleod became editor of the Free Church of Scotland\u2019s <em>Monthly Record<\/em>. In what might otherwise have been an obscure periodical, Macleod made the magazine home to some of Scotland\u2019s most thoughtful (if also controversial) cultural and theological commentaries. One month, Macleod would be engaging in a theological critique of T. F. Torrance\u2019s view of Christ\u2019s fallen human nature. In the next, he&#8217;d be taking his chief political antagonist Margaret Thatcher to task for ignoring the plight of the poor.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Macleod\u2019s most lasting influence came through the classroom, where he taught virtually every prospective Free Church minister for decades.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Macleod would go on to write weekly columns for more than two decades at the <em>West Highland Free Press <\/em>and later the <em>Stornoway Gazette<\/em>, both regional papers in the Highlands and Islands. That he devoted so much of his time and effort to the concerns of this region speaks volumes about his own sense of identity as a Gael. Spending most of his life far away from the Highlands in Edinburgh, Macleod considered himself an exile, and he never stopped speaking back to the place that had made him who he was. His last column ran on April 20.<\/p>\n<p>Macleod\u2019s life wasn&#8217;t without significant and painful conflict. For reasons both personal and theological, in the 1990s he became a lightning rod of controversy within the Free Church of Scotland. Denominational tensions, which often ostensibly revolved around Macleod\u2019s life and work, came to a head in 2000 when a group of ministers and churches left the Free Church of Scotland to form the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing).<\/p>\n<h3>Passionate Preacher<\/h3>\n<p>The central passion of Macleod\u2019s life was preaching. He once wrote,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Each Lord\u2019s Day, congregations should be led to the point where they cry, \u201cOh! The depth!\u201d And if they are not\u2014if we have robbed the Gospel of the great elements of mystery and wonder and depth and paradox\u2014then we have failed in our mission and cheated our people. . . . The only message we have a right to preach is one so astonishing that angels desire to look into it and so profound that they have to stoop to do so.<\/p>\n<p>This was where Macleod was in his element, stretching the English language to its limits to communicate the love of God in Jesus Christ. He was notorious for the idiosyncrasies of his presentation\u2014he never made eye contact, and the intonation of his thick Lewis accent was at times difficult to follow. And yet many who knew him as theologian, journalist, and preacher said it was in his sermons that he left his most indelible mark.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday evening, shortly before his death, I preached at a congregation in Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. I was making small talk with two church members in the fellowship hall after the service, and our conversation came around to the fact that I was in Scotland studying Macleod\u2019s work. The people\u2019s faces lit up. Several stopped to tell me about some personal interaction with Macleod years before. One man pulled me aside for 15 minutes to ask about Macleod\u2019s doctrine of God. Another told me proudly about how he&#8217;d sat through Macleod&#8217;s systematic theology course in 1980. He proceeded to quote verbatim Macleod\u2019s opening lines from the first lecture. Later in the evening, he brought me a photocopy of his hand-written notes from the class. His wife said these were the only papers from seminary he refused to throw away.<\/p>\n<p>Having preached throughout Scotland for almost three years, I wasn&#8217;t surprised by these interactions. Donald Macleod had a reputation as &#8220;the people\u2019s theologian&#8221;\u2014so much so that I often heard him referenced in conversations as &#8220;the professor.&#8221; For many who never had formal theological education, Macleod was still their teacher.<\/p>\n<p>In his last essay as editor of the <em>Monthly Record <\/em>in 1990, Macleod wrote on the nature of heaven. He concluded that in heaven<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">there is total <em>shalom<\/em>: a sense of sheer well-being. Every need is met. Every longing is fulfilled. Every goal is achieved. Every sense is satisfied. We see Him. We are with Him. He holds us and hugs us and whispers, \u201cThis is for ever.\u201d<\/p>\n",

I would.\u201d He said, \u201cYou really want clarity, huh? OK, I\u2019ll pray for that for you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The next morning\u2014less than 12 hours later\u2014I woke up and read this line from Aimee Joseph\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Demystifying-Decision-Making-Practical-Gospel-Coalition\/dp\/1433575418\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Demystifying Decision-Making<\/i><\/a>: \u201cWe far too easily demand clarity from our Creator when, instead of clarity, he would rather cultivate faith in us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I suppose God answered my prayer for clarity quicker than expected.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of giving me clarity of <em>direction<\/em>, he gave me clarity of <em>priority<\/em>\u2014reminding me that increased trust is infinitely more valuable than a divine blueprint for what to do.<\/p>\n<p>Consider three ways trust in God is more valuable than clarity.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Clarity might help you now; trust will help you for a lifetime.<\/h4>\n<p>The difference between clarity and trust is similar to the difference between a painkiller and true healing. We often long for the narcotic of clarity because we want a quick fix. Clarity takes us out of the uncomfortable\u2014out of a place of dependence\u2014and makes us feel back in control. But is that what we need most?<\/p>\n<p>If God gave us clarity, that may (or may not) help us with a particular decision, but it would never help us again. Trust would help us for a lifetime (Ps. 125:1\u20132).<\/p>\n<p>Those who trust the Lord don\u2019t thrive because they always have clarity but because they deem the One who holds the future worthy of their soul\u2019s deepest rest. The security we long for doesn\u2019t come from knowing the future but from knowing and trusting God.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The security we long for doesn\u2019t come from knowing the future but from knowing and trusting God.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Don\u2019t misunderstand me: clarity isn&#8217;t a bad thing. It&#8217;s often the fruit of faith in action. But don\u2019t rush past the seasons of life that feel unclear. Don\u2019t live in the future and miss the preciousness of what God is trying to teach you right now. If you learn to trust God even in unclear seasons, your efforts will bear sweet fruit for the rest of your life and for all eternity.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Clarity allows you to move on; trust allows God to move in.<\/h4>\n<p>One of the hardest parts of unclear seasons is feeling stuck\u2014like we can\u2019t move forward in any areas of life until we resolve the unclear area. But remember two truths.<\/p>\n<p>First, if you do nothing in this present season except deepen your trust in God, it&#8217;ll be one of the most productive seasons of your life (James 1:2\u20134). The product of clarity is a decision; the product of trust is a relationship. Which is more productive in the long run? I appreciate Ann Voskamp\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Daring-Hope-Finding-Goodness-Beautiful\/dp\/0735290601\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">observation<\/a>: \u201cToo often we want clarity, and God wants us to come closer.\u201d Is it possible that God is allowing this season of waiting to deepen your communion with him?<\/p>\n<p>Second, God may be slowing you down in some areas of life, but he doesn\u2019t want you to stop moving. Don\u2019t sit on the sideline while you wait for clarity in one area. God usually gives us clarity not while we&#8217;re sitting on our hands and fixating on a decision but while we&#8217;re actively focusing on his mission.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Clarity gives you <i>something<\/i> to run to; trust gives you <i>someone<\/i> to run to.<\/h4>\n<p>One of the most precious gems in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/reviews\/demystifying-decision-making\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Demystifying Decision-Making<\/i><\/a> is a story Aimee Joseph tells about her son after he made a poor decision. If you feel uncertain about the past or future, be encouraged by this story today:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">My nine-year-old son stood with his bicycle at the top of the steep hill in front of our house. His gaggle of neighborhood friends stood at the base of the hill where my husband and I were doing some gardening. Suddenly my son cried out from the top of the hill, \u201cHey guys, watch this!\u201d My husband and I immediately looked up in alarm, as those are dangerous words coming from a young boy. Much to our surprise, our son\u2019s next move was not to ride down the hill on the bike but to send the bike down the hill without a rider. Our eyes moved back and forth between the bike, which was picking up speed, and the new-to-us car toward which it was headed. Sure enough, the bike slammed into the side of the car as we watched in shock and horror. My son, recognizing what he had done and not even understanding himself why he had done it, began running down the hill. I fully expected him to run to his room in embarrassment, but he did something we did not expect. He ran directly into my husband\u2019s arms, paying my husband one of the greatest compliments of his life. In a moment when fear of shame and consequences might have made him run from his father, he chose to run to his arms. He knew his father well enough to know that there would surely be consequences, but he also knew that his father loved him far more than he was disappointed with him.<\/p>\n<p>Joseph\u2019s story helps us see the all-surpassing value of trust. Trust not only helps us make decisions without being paralyzed by fear but also gives us someone to run to even when we make poor decisions.<\/p>\n<h3>Run to Your Father\u2019s Arms<\/h3>\n<p>Feeling clarity isn&#8217;t always a stamp of God\u2019s approval or a guarantee of good outcomes. Trust in God gives us confidence that regardless of the outcome, we have a loving and sovereign Father who&#8217;s always with us and ready to embrace us in his loving arms (Luke 15:20).<\/p>\n<p>Our future is unknown, but God\u2019s character and promises aren&#8217;t. Let\u2019s rest today knowing our God is supremely trustworthy and will redeem all our decisions for his glory and our good (Rom. 8:28).<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim Kuperus isn\u2019t new to pastoral ministry\u2014he\u2019s been doing it full-time for 25 years. So he&#8217;s familiar with church controversy and challenges. He\u2019s seen his share of long hours, hard conversations, and difficult situations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBut I never once thought about whether I was still called to ministry,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until the past three years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was the convergence of so much in a compressed time, from the toxic political situation to the absolute challenge of the pandemic,\u201d said Kuperus, who leads Manhattan Christian Reformed Church in Montana. \u201cWhen arguing over a piece of cloth can tear your people apart, you start to question the core of what you thought was shaping your church\u2019s identity together as a people in Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When arguing over a piece of cloth can tear your people apart, you start to question the core of what you thought was shaping your church\u2019s identity together as a people in Christ.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kuperus wasn\u2019t the only one. In January 2021, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.barna.com\/research\/pastors-well-being\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">29 percent<\/a> of pastors told Barna they&#8217;d seriously considered leaving ministry within the past year. Ten months later, that was up to 38 percent. By March 2022, it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.barna.com\/research\/pastors-quitting-ministry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">42 percent<\/a>. The main reasons? The immense stress of the job, feeling lonely and isolated, and current political divisions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe had 40 people walk out\u201d over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/crc-corrects\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">perceived liberalism<\/a> in the Christian Reformed Church denomination, Kuperus said. After a while, \u201cI lost the joy of ministry,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But he didn\u2019t walk away. In fact, despite rumors of a mass migration, most pastors stayed. In the fall of 2021, the rate of evangelical pastors quitting before retirement was <a href=\"https:\/\/research.lifeway.com\/2021\/10\/25\/few-pastors-left-the-pulpit-despite-increased-pressure\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1.5 percent<\/a>, up only a little from the 1.3 percent resignation rate in 2015.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBecause information flows so quickly today, it is easy to string together a handful of crowd-sourced stories of pastors quitting and to assume you have a new trend or a new epidemic in the American church,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/research.lifeway.com\/2021\/05\/13\/are-more-pastors-quitting-today\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote<\/a> Lifeway Research executive director Scott McConnell. \u201cIn reality, even a list of 100 pastors is still a fraction of the normal range of pastors changing career direction in a typical month.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gospel Coalition asked three pastors, each of whom would have told Barna he gave &#8220;real, serious consideration to quitting being in full-time ministry&#8221; during the pandemic, why they didn\u2019t\u2014and why they\u2019re glad they stayed.<\/p>\n<h3>Seriously Considering Quitting<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf pastors are being honest, they probably ask themselves whether they should quit more than they care to admit,\u201d said Ronnie Martin, pastor of Substance Church in Ashland, Ohio. \u201cIn a world full of options, made far more readily available to us because of technology and remote work, those things are easier to imagine in terms of possibilities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His church lost about 60 members over mask policy disagreements. \u201cI thought my life would be so much easier if I were doing anything but this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even just having conversations with those individuals so much as it was the level of anxiety and paranoia it produced. I kept wondering how many other people were thinking like they were.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Jeremy Writebol\u2019s Woodside Bible Church in metro Detroit, half of the 350 members left after he prayed about racialized violence after George Floyd\u2019s death.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey thought I was woke,\u201d he said. \u201cThey thought I was advocating for critical race theory.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He couldn\u2019t change their minds, and it seemed like he\u2019d blown up the whole church. \u201cI began to ask questions of myself\u2014Am I called to do this? What did I do wrong?\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin was wondering the same thing. \u201cAm I built for this? Or are there other things I should be doing?\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Why They Stayed<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin didn\u2019t wrestle long. \u201cI had moments of darkness and despair, but they were short-lived,\u201d he said. It helped that he felt supported by his family, his elders, and the other pastors in his network. He was also feeling a morbid curiosity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI wondered\u2014What will happen if we can just endure?\u201d he said. \u201cLord, what are you surfacing in me? If I can endure, I\u2019d love to see the person I am becoming emerge from this.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He knows how it sounds\u2014\u201cmore romantic than it felt at the time.\u201d It wasn\u2019t romance, but the Bible, he was hanging on to. \u201cIt was a time for waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lord told us in Scripture 227 times that we have to wait and hope.\u201d So he did.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If I can endure, I\u2019d love to see the person I am becoming emerge from this.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kuperus was also waiting. Six months passed, then a year, and he still didn\u2019t feel his previous joy in ministry. He worried he might never get it back.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He kept going anyway.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI can\u2019t say enough about what it means to have a place of peace and rest in your home,\u201d he said. \u201cI am blessed with an incredible spouse. When everything externally was fraught, I knew that home would always be a place of peace and rest. That was so grounding for me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also held onto his sense of calling. \u201cI didn\u2019t just wake up one day and decide I was going to be a pastor,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a deep internal and external sense of calling.\u201d While he was wrestling with that internal call, people in his congregation and denomination kept affirming him externally. Congregants dropped him notes or emails that were more encouraging than they knew. Every week, two elders met with him to encourage and pray for him. And he didn\u2019t ever want to go to his classis\u2014a regional gathering of pastors and elders\u2014and tell them he was quitting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine being in front of my dear fellow pastors and saying, \u2018I\u2019m finished,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat horrified me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over in Michigan, Writebol was also leaning on his elders. He asked them, \u201cAm I doing harm to the church in such a way that I shouldn\u2019t be leading here locally?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, they told him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey had my back all the way, which was very affirming and helpful to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never said, \u2018Yeah, you should think about leaving.\u2019 It was always \u2018We trust you. We\u2019re with you.\u2019 Sometimes a comment I made wasn\u2019t helpful or well-received, and they were able to correct me in those moments, but they didn\u2019t lose trust in me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Martin and Kuperus, Writebol didn\u2019t feel released from his calling. \u201cThe Lord hasn\u2019t opened another door for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a sense of being called to anything else. I\u2019m feeling very called here. . . . The work he\u2019s given me is not done yet, and nobody is telling me to get out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One reason he knows that is the paycheck. His church pays a fair salary and offers benefits.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI know I have skills that would be transferable to corporate America, but I have no vision of what I could be doing there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in ministry for 20-plus years. This is my vocation and career. I have no idea how to restart something else or the financial savings we\u2019d need for me to explore for a while. I have to do this ministry, because it\u2019s the work the Lord has given me to do, and because it is the way the Lord is providing financially for our family.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>How They Stayed<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to stay, sometimes the pastors had to take a step out. Martin dug into classic novels\u2014primarily Jane Austen and the Bront\u00eb sisters. Kuperus spent time woodworking or doing sports photography.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were also escaping into their Bibles.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI spent a three- or four-month period praying through and meditating on the Psalms,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat was a massive help, a balm.\u201d Kuperus spent time there too, especially in Psalm 46.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writebol was writing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Pastor-Jesus-Enough-Burned-Broken\/dp\/1683596730\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">book for pastors<\/a> on the Revelation passages about the seven churches. He fell in love with chapters 2 and 3.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEven Revelation 1:5\u2014that verse grounds my identity,\u201d he said. \u201cI am loved by Christ. I belong to him. Later we read the imagery of Jesus holding the seven stars in his hand, and that\u2019s a metaphor to me of Christ holding me in his hand in spite of all of the turmoil.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Christians John was writing to were in the Roman Empire, facing heavy and violent persecution. That helped put things in perspective for Writebol.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThose were important passages that anchored my heart over the last few years and reminded me of Jesus\u2019s sufficiency, of his love for me, of his sovereignty, wisdom, and goodness,\u201d he said. \u201cHe keeps calling me back to remember who he is so I can remember who I am as well.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>On the Other Side<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most congregants aren\u2019t wearing masks anymore, but many pastors are still processing, Martin said. \u201cBecause trauma surfaces slowly, sometimes I wonder if some of us are just beginning to deal with some of these things.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s not all bad. \u201cFor me, the moments of darkness and despair were short-lived, and they led to longing and searching,\u201d he said. His prayer was \u201cLord, we\u2019re seeking some relief, and we have to find it in you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sifting in his church, while painful, left a more united congregation. \u201cWe looked around and saw people who were serving the church, who were on mission with us, who were encouraging us with their words,\u201d he said. \u201cI had the sense that the people here wanted to be here. We had a newfound sense of unity, and when that emerged it was hugely encouraging to us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin also felt the sifting in himself. \u201cI realized I really trust in the affirmation of my congregation\u2014I want them to tell me everything is OK,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when they had opinions on things we\u2019ve never had to talk about before, and we weren\u2019t on the same page, I didn\u2019t feel supported or encouraged.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a hard grace because it strengthened his reliance on the Lord alone, Martin said. When he frames it that way, he\u2019s grateful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019d say I love God more, and I think I feel more loved by God, after going through this,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I love God more, and I think I feel more loved by God, after going through this.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kuperus can see changes too. Hard and angry attitudes are softening. His own joy is starting to return. He can see shoots of life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI turned 50 in May of 2021,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was on a Sunday, and the church threw me a surprise party after the service. They had balloons and donuts and the whole nine yards. After that terrible, hard year, that celebration expressed something to me. I felt deeply cherished. In ways I didn\u2019t expect, it reaffirmed my calling to my dear congregation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It felt like a celebration of survival. And even though his church was smaller, Kuperus decided to minister not to the church he used to have but to the one he has now.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a good place to be. \u201cWe worship with about 250 on a Sunday, and right now there are seven young women who are pregnant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like God is showing us through the physical new life that there is also new life and joy in our congregation.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Looking Ahead<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As American culture secularizes, it\u2019s not hard to envision a future where things are harder for the church.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMaybe the pandemic was a preparation for something else,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt helps me to realize whatever the Lord allows the American church to have to endure, it is for the purpose of our perseverance, of our love for him not to grow cold.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThose days will probably come for me, when trying to stand up for what is true and right in culture and to speak the truth in love and to shepherd God\u2019s people will come with costs,\u201d Writebol said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to navigate through this world while hanging onto Christ. I trust and fully believe Christ holds us. I\u2019m going to keep looking to him and trusting in him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pastoral ministry is a high and noble calling, Writebol said. Most days, he wouldn\u2019t want to be doing anything else.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHis calling to me as a pastor is to be the one who carries the theology of the cross, who shows people this is what Jesus has done for you,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s fix our eyes on him and he\u2019ll get us home.\u201d<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p class=\"p1\">My life is a parade of questions\u2014a nearly 65-year procession of <i>whys<\/i> and <i>how longs<\/i>, met mostly with divine silence. God has never whispered his secrets to me; I imagine because his reasons corresponding to my <i>whys<\/i> would be unfathomable, even if explained (Deut. 29:29; Isa. 55:8\u20139; Rom. 11:33\u201334). This has left me with scores of lament-filled and faith-challenging mysteries.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/going-through-hell\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my medically incurable stage four cancer.<\/a> Doctors give me no hope for cancer-free remission. Instead, they\u2019ve insisted from the outset that my cancer isn&#8217;t going away. Treatments might stall it, but unless God intervenes (my caveat, not theirs), my cancer will eventually consume me. It\u2019s only a matter of time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But that\u2019s an additional question: <i>When<\/i> is it going to happen? This question creates acute psychological trauma for many who face what I face. It&#8217;s deeply unsettling to have incurable cancer that, while momentarily quiet, is inevitably going to raise a deadly ruckus. It\u2019s not if, but when.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If one\u2019s heart isn\u2019t fixed on God, the ominous, open-ended \u201cwhen?\u201d will mess with the mind. It can mess with the mind even if the heart <i>is<\/i> fixed on God.<\/span> We can choose to not think about it. We can think about it only in a perpetual state of dread or self-pity. Or we can think about it in ways that lead us\u2014however falteringly\u2014to trust and worship God.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Same Boat<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019m going to die of this cancer (or something else), but I don\u2019t know when. Likewise, everyone is going to die of something else (or of this cancer), and they don\u2019t know when either.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We\u2019re all in the same boat.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Except that things seem a little less seaworthy on my side of the dinghy. Doctors\u2019 prognoses and life-span averages say my \u201cwhen\u201d will be around 6 to 8 years younger than most American males\u2019 and at least 10 years younger than my dad\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019d feel profoundly gypped by this if I didn\u2019t know that God is perfectly just and holy. He gyps no one\u2014and I trust him in that. But still.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Indwelling Mortality, Sighing Sadness<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">I sigh a lot these days, especially when it hits me that death is already in me. That awareness will invariably tinge with grief everything I feel and do from here on out.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Anyone living with chronic suffering will know something of this. Sighing sadness marks those who wake up each morning to the same sorrow, loss, betrayal, injustice, sickness, divorce, financial hardship, and addiction. It marks the consequence of bad choices to which they woke up yesterday.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A moment of pain is one thing. Pain with no end in sight is quite another. This is the sort of enduring pain from which the <em>whys<\/em> and <em>how longs<\/em> of the saints have long emerged.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A moment of pain is one thing. Pain with no end in sight is quite another.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;d be silly to grieve a head cold from six months ago. It\u2019s over, so get over it. But what if that head cold moved in to stay, to greet you each morning for the rest of your life with the same sniffles, headache, and itching eyes? What if you never felt well again?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That\u2019s my cancer. There\u2019s indwelling sin and indwelling death, and I\u2019ve got both. I\u2019m learning how to cope, but despite my best efforts, I can\u2019t \u201cget over it\u201d completely. How does one get over what isn\u2019t over?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Chronic sufferers wish others would understand this. Well-intentioned \u201ccomforters\u201d often urge sufferers toward greater faith and to get over whatever it is they\u2019re under. But they miss that people are still weeping because it still hurts.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Between Groaning and Hope<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">I know I have joyful hope in Jesus, but life on earth is still filled with groaning (Rom. 8:22\u201323). How can it not be, given all that&#8217;s broken? There&#8217;s no Christian pixie dust strong enough to lift my heavy groaning heart and send it soaring into a happy Neverland of my own making. Life hurts too much for that.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yes, the gospel and the love of a sovereign God mean sadness need not embitter me or banish all courage and hope. And yes, I can truly say I&#8217;m always rejoicing. But I&#8217;m sorrowful nonetheless (2 Cor. 6:10). Sadness always seems but a sighing millisecond removed, like a haunting specter lurking in the shadows, stalking every moment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It helps to remind myself not to be surprised by my trials, for the path to the eternal heavenly kingdom is marked by \u201cmany afflictions,\u201d and God will see me through (Acts 14:22; 1 Pet. 1:6\u20137; 4:12\u201313; 5:6\u201311).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It helps to remember I\u2019ve received all spiritual blessings in Christ\u2014and cannot be separated from his love (Rom. 8:35\u201339; Eph. 1:3\u201314).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The gospel and the love of a sovereign God mean that sadness need not embitter me or banish all courage and hope.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">It helps to call to mind that I&#8217;m invincible until God\u2019s purposes for my life are complete. Until every good work prepared for me to do is actually done, my life won\u2019t be done (Eph. 2:10).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And it helps to remember that when my life is done, even then it won\u2019t be done. Good Friday and Easter guarantee a hope beyond\u2014hope that makes living, loving, and serving worth doing, no matter my prognosis (1 Cor. 15:50\u201358).<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">More Important than Why or When<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">On my best days, I know that \u201cwhy\u201d or \u201cwhen\u201d questions aren&#8217;t my concern. God alone knows. I need only be concerned with a \u201cwhat\u201d question: \u201cLord, what would you have me to be, do, and enjoy? What should be the objects of my listening, learning, lamenting, loving, laughing, and looking in the time that remains for me?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That\u2019s how I think on my best days. On all my other days, I cry silently in my chair, fight off despair, beat down my fears, extinguish Satan\u2019s flaming darts, and keep trusting that our Savior\u2019s mighty arms will keep my dinghy afloat until he lands me safely on heaven\u2019s golden shore, where sighing and dying will be no more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">And I\u2019m guessing that in this fight, fear, and hope, I&#8217;m not alone.<\/p>\n",

The Gospel Coalition cofounder was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/Timothy-Keller\/author\/B001H6SAQW?tag=thegospcoal-20\">a prolific author<\/a>, and all his sermons at Redeemer Presbyterian Church are <a href=\"https:\/\/gospelinlife.com\">now available for free<\/a>. You can also read about his life in Collin Hansen&#8217;s recent\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/20-quotes-biography-tim-keller\/\"><em>Timothy Keller: His Intellectual and Spiritual Formation<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to measure this man&#8217;s impact on my life and ministry\u2014and on countless others. Here are 50 of my favorite Keller quotes.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&#8220;All death can now do to Christians is to make their lives infinitely better.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The central basis of Christian assurance is not how much our hearts are set on God, but how unshakably his heart is set on us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If Jesus rose from the dead, then you have to accept all that he said. If he didn\u2019t, then why worry about any of what he said? The issue on which everything hangs is not whether you like his teaching, but whether he rose from the dead.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Describe the God you\u2019ve rejected. Describe the God you don\u2019t believe in. Maybe I don\u2019t believe that God either.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Contemporary people tend to examine the Bible, looking for things they can\u2019t accept; but Christians should reverse that, allowing the Bible to examine us, looking for things God can\u2019t accept.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&#8220;Satan doesn\u2019t control us with fang marks on the flesh but with lies in the heart. . . . Our best defense in the fight against [his] lies is not the production of incantations but the rehearsal of truth.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The gospel is that I am so sinful that Jesus had to die for me, yet so loved and valued that Jesus was glad to die for me. This leads to deep humility and deep confidence at the same time. I can\u2019t feel superior to anyone, and yet I have nothing to prove to anyone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&#8220;The doctrine of sin means believers are never as good as our true worldview should make us. And the doctrine of common grace means unbelievers are never as flawed as their false worldview should make them.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&#8220;Only if your god can outrage and challenge you will you know that you worship the real God and not a figment of your imagination. . . .\u00a0<\/span>If your god never disagrees with you, you might just be worshiping an idealized version of yourself.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The glory of God is available to you in the church in a way it\u2019s not available to you anywhere else. . . . There is no more important means of discipleship than deep involvement in the life of the church.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You don\u2019t fall into love. You commit to it. Love says, &#8216;I will be there no matter what.\u2019&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To say &#8216;I know God forgives me, but I can\u2019t forgive myself&#8217; means you\u2019ve failed an idol whose approval is more important than God\u2019s.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you make work your identity and you succeed, it\u2019ll go to your head. If you fail, it\u2019ll go to your heart.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To be loved but not known is superficial. To be known but not loved is our nightmare. Only Jesus knows us to the bottom and loves us to the sky.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The only person who dares wake up a\u00a0king\u00a0at 3:00 a.m. for a glass of water is a child.\u00a0We have that kind of access.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&#8220;Tolerance isn\u2019t about not having beliefs. It\u2019s about how your beliefs lead you to treat people who disagree with you.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&#8220;Traditional religion says, &#8216;I give God a good moral record, so he has to bless me.&#8217; The gospel says, &#8216;God gives me a good moral record through Christ, so I want to bless him.\u2019 . . .\u00a0<\/span>Religion says, &#8216;If I obey, then God will love and accept me.&#8217; The gospel says, &#8216;God loves and accepts me, therefore I want to obey.\u2019&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&#8220;The gospel says\u00a0you are simultaneously more sinful and flawed than you ever dared believe, yet more loved and accepted than you ever dared hope.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you\u2019re falling off a cliff, strong faith in a weak branch is fatally inferior to weak faith in a strong branch. Salvation is not finally based on the strength of your faith, but on the object of your faith.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"caret-color: #000000;\">&#8220;<\/span><\/span>The temptation for those who suffer is to assume that because we can\u2019t\u00a0think of any\u00a0good purposes God may have for our suffering, there can\u2019t be any.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are the good things of this world, the hard things of this world, and the best things of this world\u2014God\u2019s love, glory, holiness, beauty. The Bible\u2019s teaching is that the road to the best things is not through the good things but usually through the hard things. . . . There is no message more contrary to the way the world understands life or more subversive to its values.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Christian sex ethic was understood by the apostles to be a nonnegotiable part of orthodoxy, one of the core beliefs of Christianity. What Christians taught and practiced about sexuality was as much a necessary implication of the gospel and the resurrection as were care for the poor and the equality of the races. This makes it impossible to argue, as many try to do, that what the Bible says about caring for the poor is right but what it says about sex is outmoded and should be discarded.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sex apart from marriage becomes a product we consume if we find someone attractive enough in quality and low enough in price. If the quality goes down or the cost goes up, we can walk away, because there is no covenant. But if sex comes only with the radical self-giving and whole-life commitment of marriage, that takes sex off the market, as it were, and makes it priceless.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When Jesus Christ was in the garden of Gethsemane and the ultimate darkness was coming down on him and he knew it was coming, he didn\u2019t abandon you; he died for you. If Jesus Christ didn\u2019t abandon you in\u00a0<em>his\u00a0<\/em>darkness, the ultimate darkness, why would he abandon you now, in yours?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Only a grasp of what Jesus did on the cross\u2014the doctrine of substitutionary atonement\u2014can prevent spiritual distortions. . . . Only this doctrine keeps us from thinking God is mainly holy with some love or mainly loving with some holiness\u2014but instead [he] is both holy and loving equally, interdependently. Only this view of God makes the spoiled or the neglected into the healthy and the loved.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The secular framework . . . has nothing to give the wounded conscience to heal it. It has nothing to say to the self who feels it is unworthy of love and forgiveness. Anyone who has seen the depths of their sin and what they are capable of will never be mollified by the bromide of &#8216;Be nice to yourself\u2014you deserve it.\u2019&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;True repentance begins where whitewashing (&#8216;Nothing really happened&#8217;) and blame-shifting (&#8216;It wasn\u2019t really my fault&#8217;) and self-pity (&#8216;I\u2019m sorry because of what it has cost\u00a0<em>me<\/em>\u2019) and self-flagellation (&#8216;I will feel so terrible no one will be able to criticize me&#8217;) end.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Forgiveness is granted (often a good while) before it is felt\u2014not felt before it is granted. It is a promise to\u00a0<em>not\u00a0<\/em>exact the price of sin from the person who hurt you. . . . It is likely you have always thought, &#8216;Well, I have to feel it before I grant it. I have to start feeling less angry before I start to not hold them liable.&#8217; If you wait to feel it before you grant it, you\u2019ll never grant it; you\u2019ll be in an anger prison.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"caret-color: #000000;\">&#8220;I<\/span><\/span>t is hard to stay angry at someone if you are praying for them. It is also hard to stay angry unless you feel superior, and it is hard to feel superior if you are praying for them, since in prayer you approach God as a forgiven sinner.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Prayer is the only entryway into genuine self-knowledge. It is also the main way we experience deep change\u2014the reordering of our loves. Prayer is how God gives us so many of the unimaginable things he has for us. Indeed, prayer makes it safe for God to give us many of the things we most desire. It is the way we know God, the way we finally treat God\u00a0<em>as\u00a0<\/em>God. Prayer is simply the key to everything we need to do and be in life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;God will either give us what we ask or give us what we would have asked if we knew everything he knows.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We know God will answer us when we call because one terrible day he did\u00a0<em>not\u00a0<\/em>answer Jesus when\u00a0<em>he\u00a0<\/em>called. . . . Jesus\u2019 prayers were given the rejection that we sinners merit so that our prayers could have the reception that he merits.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&#8220;Mercy isn\u2019t just the job of the Christian. Mercy is the mark of the Christian.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A good sermon is not like a club that beats upon the will but like a sword that cuts to the heart.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Expository preaching should provide the main diet of preaching for a Christian community. . . . [It] is the best method for displaying and conveying your conviction that the whole Bible is true. This approach testifies that you believe every part of the Bible to be God\u2019s Word, not just particular themes and not just the parts you feel comfortable agreeing with.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Preaching is not only explaining the text but also using it to engage the heart. I often see preachers giving so much time to the first task that they put little thought and ingenuity into the second.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every time you expound a Bible text, you are not finished unless you demonstrate how it shows us that we cannot save ourselves and that only Jesus can.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Christian communicators must show that we remember (or at least understand) very well what it is like not to believe.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The humanistic moral values of secularism are not the deliverances of scientific reasoning, but have come down to us from older times . . . they have a theological history. And modern people hold them by faith alone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Through faith in the cross we get a new foundation for an identity that both humbles us out of our egoism yet is so infallibly secure in love that we are enabled to embrace rather than exclude those who are different.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[These are] Christianity\u2019s unsurpassed offers\u2014a meaning that suffering cannot remove, a satisfaction not based on circumstances, a freedom that does not hurt but rather enhances love, an identity that does not crush you or exclude others, a moral compass that does not turn you into an oppressor, and a hope that can face anything, even death.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If the suffering Jesus endured did not make him give up on us, nothing will.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Jesus is one of the very few persons in history who founded a great world religion or who, like Plato or Aristotle, has set the course of human thought and life for centuries. Jesus is in that tiny, select group. On the other hand, there have been a number of persons over the years who have implicitly or explicitly claimed to be divine beings from other worlds. Many of them were demagogues; many more were leaders of small, self-contained sects of true believers. What is unique about Jesus is that he is the only member of the first set of persons who is also a member of the second.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Everything in the Hebrew worldview militated against the idea that a human being could be God. Jews would not even pronounce the name &#8216;Yahweh&#8217; nor spell it. And yet Jesus Christ\u2014by his life, by his claims, and by his resurrection\u2014convinced his closest Jewish followers that he was not just a prophet telling them how to find God, but God himself come to find us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you come to Christ, you must drop your conditions. You have to give up the right to say, &#8216;I will obey you\u00a0<em>if<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>. . . I will do this\u00a0<em>if<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>. . .&#8217; As soon as you say, &#8216;I will obey you\u00a0<em>if<\/em>,&#8217; that is not obedience at all. You are saying: &#8216;You are my adviser, not my Lord. I will be happy to take your recommendations. And I might even do some of them.&#8217; No. If you want Jesus\u00a0<em>with you<\/em>, you have to give up the right to self-determination. Self-denial is an act of rebellion against our late-modern culture of self-assertion. But that is what we are called to. Nothing less.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you say, &#8216;Doctrine doesn\u2019t matter; what matters is that you live a good life,&#8217; that\u00a0<em>is<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>a doctrine. It is called the doctrine of salvation by your works rather than by grace.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s in death that God says, &#8216;If I\u2019m not your security, then you\u2019ve got no security, because I\u2019m the only thing that can\u2019t be taken away from you. I will hold you in my everlasting arms. Every other set of arms will fail you, but I will never fail you.&#8217; Smelling salts are very disagreeable, but they are also very effective. But as you\u2019re waking from your illusions, be at peace, because here\u2019s what Jesus Christ offers to us if by faith we have him as our Savior.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you want to understand your own behavior, you must understand that all sin against God is grounded in a refusal to believe that God is more dedicated to our good, and more aware of what that is, than we are. We distrust God because we assume he is not truly for us, that if we give him complete control we will be miserable. Adam and Eve did not say, &#8216;Let\u2019s be evil. Let\u2019s ruin our own lives and everyone else\u2019s too!&#8217; Rather they thought, &#8216;We just want to be happy. But his commands don\u2019t look like they\u2019ll give us the things we need to thrive. We\u2019ll have to take things into our own hands\u2014we can\u2019t trust him.\u2019&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The only storm that can really destroy\u2014the storm of divine justice and judgment on sin and evil\u2014will never come upon you. Jesus bowed his head into that ultimate storm, willingly, for you. He died, receiving the punishment for sin we deserve, so we can be pardoned when we trust in him. When you see him\u00a0doing that for you, it certainly does not answer all the\u00a0questions you have about your suffering. But it proves that, despite it all, he still loves you. Because he was thrown into\u00a0<em>that <\/em>storm for you, you can be sure that there\u2019s love at the heart of<em>\u00a0<\/em><em>this <\/em>storm for you.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you were a hundred times worse than you are, your sins would be no match for his mercy.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>As I stared at a blank computer screen in January 2021, a distressing thought overwhelmed me.<\/p>\n<p><em>Never meet your heroes<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d just contracted to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Timothy-Keller-Spiritual-Intellectual-Formation\/dp\/0310128684\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">write about the spiritual and intellectual formation of Timothy Keller<\/a>. I\u2019d worked with Tim since 2008. But now I\u2019d be talking to his oldest friends, his closest colleagues. What would they say about him? What would I learn? What skeletons would I find in his closet?<\/p>\n<p>What felt like an enormous privilege suddenly struck me as likely disillusionment.<\/p>\n<p>Two and a half years later, I\u2019m mourning the death of this hero. In his final years, I got to see Tim through the eyes of family and friends who knew him almost his entire life, even before he became a Christian in 1970. And I got to know him not as a distant hero but as a personal friend who helped me love Jesus.<\/p>\n<h3>Cross Words<\/h3>\n<p>I never heard Tim Keller speak a cross word about anyone else. Maybe that\u2019s what you should expect from someone who spoke so many words about the cross. But that\u2019s not the norm in my ministry experience. I know I&#8217;ve wasted more words on criticism than I\u2019d like to confess. Unfortunately, if you want to complain, you can always find a willing ear.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I never heard Tim Keller speak a cross word about anyone else.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But that wasn\u2019t Tim Keller. He never picked up the phone to call me in anger about how he\u2019d been slandered. He never fired off a frustrated text when I published something that embarrassed him as the cofounder of The Gospel Coalition. He never composed long emails full of criticism of my writing or my leadership as executive director of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/thekellercenter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Keller Center for Cultural Apologetics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m ashamed to remember how I raised my voice at him in frustration during one of our last phone conversations. I was upset about a decision he made. All he did was listen to my concerns and promise to help in ways only he could. He followed through and blessed my work with a gift I could never repay. He did this while suffering with cancer, as he lay dying of this terrible disease. I watched him live out Romans 12:17\u201318: \u201cRepay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>On Criticism<\/h3>\n<p>Maybe you could say Tim acted peaceably because he hated confrontation, because he wanted to be liked. I worked with him long enough to know he sometimes caused confusion when he avoided hard conversations. After I wrote the book, I didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d respond when he read about former staff members who complained about his poor management skills. I don\u2019t know many pastors or other ministry leaders who allow such criticism to enter the public record, if they can help it.<\/p>\n<p>Tim allowed it. He even owned his responsibility for frustrating his staff. I thought of 1 John 1:9: \u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You know you\u2019re in trouble when you meet leaders who are quick to criticize others and slow to admit their own faults. And yet that\u2019s a common approach across church leadership. Not with Tim. He practiced what he preached. He often referred to the <a href=\"https:\/\/timothykeller.com\/blog\/2009\/12\/16\/how-do-you-take-criticism-of-your-views\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">advice from John Newton<\/a> in the letter \u201cOn Controversy.\u201d Tim tried to find truth even in the barbs of his harshest critics:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">There is <em>usually<\/em> such a kernel when the criticism comes from friends, and there is <em>often<\/em> such truth when the disapproval comes from people who actually know you. So even if the censure is partly or even largely mistaken, look for what you may indeed have done wrong. Perhaps you simply acted or spoke in a way that was not circumspect. Maybe the critic is partly right for the wrong reasons. Nevertheless, identify your own short-comings, repent in your own heart before the Lord for what you can, and let that humble you. It will then be possible to learn from the criticism and stay gracious to the critic even if you have to disagree with what he or she has said.<\/p>\n<p>Tim wrote this reflection before social media peaked, before he became a popular target for criticism from Christians across the political and theological spectrum. But I didn\u2019t notice any change in his views or attitude. When Christians react this way to criticism, you have a good idea that the grace of God is operating in their hearts. As Newton taught us, God\u2019s amazing grace helps the lost find their way home. It helps the blind see. It saves a wretch like you and me.<\/p>\n<h3>Call to Ministry<\/h3>\n<p>Tim didn\u2019t like criticizing others. And he didn\u2019t like talking about himself. But he did enjoy talking. So what did he enjoy talking about? His wife of nearly 50 years, Kathy. The latest book or doctoral dissertation he\u2019d read. And Jesus. Above all, he loved to talk about Jesus. If you listened to a sermon by Tim, or read one of his many books, then you encountered Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>One reviewer of my book about Tim made a point I\u2019m embarrassed to say I never even considered. How could I have overlooked such a basic, important question? I didn\u2019t write about Tim\u2019s call to ministry. I didn\u2019t ask him about it. I didn\u2019t ask anyone else about it.<\/p>\n<p>But I think I know why. Once Tim experienced the grace of God in 1970, there was never any question how he would spend his life, all the way until his dying breath. Grace transformed an alienated, awkward teenager into one of the most beloved preachers of the last century. Tim couldn\u2019t help but testify to the God who knew him completely and loved him perfectly.<\/p>\n<p>I want to spend my life the same way. I want to die the same way, trying to help everyone see their desperate need for Jesus, how the Savior offers us a better life than we could have ever imagined.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>He couldn\u2019t help but testify to the God who knew him completely and loved him perfectly.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I met my hero, Tim Keller. In the last three years, as I knew him better, I respected him more. He was my hero because when I read or listened to him, I loved Jesus more. When Tim and I catch up someday in the new heavens and the new earth, I can\u2019t wait to hear all he\u2019s learned. But for now, Tim\u2019s death leaves a void I can never fill. I\u2019ll miss his encouragement. I\u2019ll miss his teaching. I\u2019ll miss the books he never got to write. I\u2019ll miss his friendship, the long conversations about anything and everything in ministry. For many in my generation, even if they only grew up listening to his sermons or reading his books, Tim Keller became a spiritual father.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m sad for us.

      "rendered": "<p>\u201cThe hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you\u201d (Philem. 7). That high praise cannot be given to all Christians, sadly. But it certainly can and should be said of Tim Keller. It\u2019s what I want to say here, with personal gratitude.<\/p>\n<p>Tim Keller was the publicly prominent voice for Christ in my generation who I trusted the most. When he spoke or wrote, I <em>never<\/em> had to brace myself for embarrassment. He rang true again and again, because he <em>was<\/em> true\u2014true to Christ.<\/p>\n<p>I first encountered Tim\u2019s ministry back in the 1980s. While still on faculty at Westminster Theological Seminary, he taught at our summer training events for PCA church planters. Then his leadership as The Gospel Coalition was being formed and defined made TGC a positive rallying point for a wide range of conscientious Christians. His books then began appearing, pressing the implications of the gospel further, right where we needed new clarity. And his preaching as pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City set a new standard for persuasive faithfulness.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>He rang true again and again, because he <em>was<\/em> true\u2014true to Christ.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As I look back over these many years, three aspects of Tim\u2019s ministry stand out in my mind.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Gospel Fullness<\/h3>\n<p>By \u201cgospel fullness\u201d I mean a principled sensitivity to the biblical gospel as <em>the<\/em> integrating center of everything that is truly Christian. I mean a reverence for the gospel as a total repositioning of each of us before God\u2014and before everyone we meet every day at every level of human engagement. Gospel fullness is how we serve Christ in ways more consistent with who he actually is, so that he becomes more visible to the watching world. Gospel fullness renews our churches too, as we stop diminishing the gospel and we start allowing the gospel to exert its power in practical change.<\/p>\n<p>In <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Center-Church-Balanced-Gospel-Centered-Ministry\/dp\/0310494184\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Center Church<\/a><\/em>, under the heading \u201cThe gospel changes everything,\u201d Tim explains:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The gospel is not just the ABCs but the A to Z of the Christian life. It is inaccurate to think the gospel is what saves non-Christians, and then Christians mature by trying hard to live according to biblical principles. It is more accurate to say that we are saved by believing the gospel, and then we are transformed in every part of our minds, hearts and lives by believing the gospel more and more deeply as life goes on.<\/p>\n<p>This is how Tim changed my ministry about 20 years ago. Many significant voices have helped me along the way: my dad, J. I. Packer, John Stott, Francis Schaeffer, and others. But when I started listening to Tim preach the gospel as a total outlook, my piecemeal thinking gladly yielded to his grander vision. Familiar themes like the cross, grace, substitution, imputation, justification by faith alone\u2014these truths and others finally converged on one focal point: the all-sufficiency of Christ for me, for everyone, in all our need. Yes, Tim was learned and articulate. But far more, he showed me a Christ bigger and better than I had been describing. And I was captivated.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Tim showed me a Christ bigger and better than I had been describing. And I was captivated.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I remember when it happened. It was on a road trip in July of 2000. I was pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Augusta, Georgia. My plan at the time was to start preaching through Romans when everyone was back in town after the summer. Before Jani and I took our own vacation, someone at church gave me a shoebox filled with cassette tapes of Tim\u2019s preaching at Redeemer. So you can picture us driving from Georgia to Iowa and back, listening to Tim hour upon hour and discussing the sermons together.<\/p>\n<p>What struck me was the sweeping relevance of his one central, repeated emphasis\u2014the gospel itself. I\u2019d been doing my best with what I knew. But here was a man declaring Christ in a way I needed and was ready for. My gospel renaissance began. And the journey through Romans back in Augusta became a turning point for our church as well.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder how many other ministers in this generation could tell similar stories.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Authentic Revival<\/h3>\n<p>Initially, this emphasis in Tim\u2019s ministry surprised me. One doesn\u2019t typically associate careful theological thinking with openness to revival and awakening. But Tim was not typical. He was consistent. Since the gospel is about more than converting individuals but also about renewing the world with outpourings of refreshment from above (e.g., Acts 3:20), authentic revival deserves to be an essential concern. Tim knew that.<\/p>\n<p>One of his seminary teachers, Richard Lovelace, influenced Tim toward sensitivity to spiritual renewal. Tim respected Lovelace\u2019s classic book <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dynamics-Spiritual-Life-Evangelical-Theology\/dp\/0830852883\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dynamics of Spiritual Life<\/a><\/em>, which is a primer for pastors who want to help their churches become revival-ready. Tim <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/blogs\/justin-taylor\/why-you-should-really-consider-this-30-year-old-book-keller-powlison-and-ortlund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">explained<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I took several courses with Richard Lovelace at Gordon-Conwell Seminary, including the first course \u201cDynamics of Spiritual Life\u201d in the Fall of 1972 that eventually became Lovelace\u2019s book. Along with that course I also took a course he did on Evangelical Awakenings\u2014a history of revivals. To say that these courses were seminal to my thinking and way of doing ministry is a pretty big understatement. Anyone who knows my ministry and reads this book will say, \u201cSo that\u2019s where Keller got all this stuff!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tim proved that the line of reasoning from the life-giving power of the gospel all the way through to its full capacities for the whole of human existence\u2014that consistent way of thinking\u2014leads to reverence for revival. And for me personally, nothing is more sacred.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Missional Wisdom<\/h3>\n<p>Tim was famous for his fair-minded, respectful public witness in our age of rancor. He knew how to \u201cwalk in wisdom toward outsiders\u201d (Col. 4:5). He thought deeply about evangelism and discipleship. And by God\u2019s grace, he was great at it. I wonder if his very reasonableness was why some people disliked Tim.<\/p>\n<p>But I remember hearing his brilliant address here in Nashville years ago that eventually became his article \u201c<a href=\"Post-Everythings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Post-Everythings<\/a>.\u201d He made the case that we don\u2019t have to submerge our bold theological convictions in order to engage nontraditional people today. What we can do is take wiser advantage of our beliefs, with gentle awareness of the riches offered there for calling \u201cpost-everything\u201d people to Christ. In his talk that day, Tim listed some of their concerns and how our own Reformed theology speaks with striking relevance.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We can take wiser advantage of our beliefs, with gentle awareness of the riches offered there for calling \u2018post-everything\u2019 people to Christ.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For example, the experiential orientation of people today finds a friend in Jonathan Edwards, who presents the gospel not only as true but also as real\u2014the very experience of God. In addition, the distaste for smug moralism in our world resonates with Martin Luther, who disconnects self-righteousness from the gospel clearly and even defiantly. What\u2019s more, our generation\u2019s intense yearning for social justice is addressed by Herman Ridderbos and other Reformed thinkers who emphasize the kingdom of God. And the love of art in our time has an advocate in Abraham Kuyper, who argues for Christianity as a total worldview, so that anyone can follow the call of Christ throughout the whole of life and culture.<\/p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s point was unarguable. Why muffle our theology in an effort to win a hearing, when our theology itself offers compelling insights into the burning issues of the day\u2014if we will be humble and wise about it? There is missional wisdom awaiting us <em>in our theology<\/em>. Tim taught me that. I\u2019m not as persuasive as Tim was. But I\u2019m better than I would have been without him.<\/p>\n<p>Tim Keller is the first of the Christian giants of my generation whom we have lost. This is sobering. How much time do you and I have left for serving the cause of Christ? However long or short it might be for me, I know this: the statement my life makes will be truer to Christ because he gave me the privilege of being influenced by Tim Keller.<\/p>\n<p>Tim, I thank God for you.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With great sadness we mourn the loss of Timothy Keller, 72, who died on May 19, more than three years after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keller co-founded The Gospel Coalition (TGC) in 2005 and served as vice president and then vice chairman of the board. As a board member until his death, Keller continued to offer counsel and direction for TGC in promoting gospel-centered ministry for the next generation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keller served in pastoral ministry for four decades, including as the founding and longtime pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan. He also served as the chairman and co-founder of the church-planting network <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/redeemercitytocity.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redeemer City to City<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

There is no pastor I know, in the last 100 years, who did what Tim Keller did to take the Reformed faith to the street, to the church, and to the academy. He will be remembered among this generation\u2019s most effective Christian pastors, apologists, and evangelists. Tim not only made the most articulate arguments for the Christian faith; he also demonstrated our faith with his humble and gracious spirit and his relentless passion to see the lost come to know the Lord he so loved. He planted the most amazing church New York City may ever have seen, he planted thousands of other churches globally through Redeemer City to City, he co-founded The Gospel Coalition, and he inspired an entire generation to love and serve the Lord. We all grieve for Kathy and the dear Keller family. And we all rejoice for the unmitigated delight that is now Tim\u2019s, as he looks upon the beautiful face of his Savior, whom he has faithfully served.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon hearing of Keller\u2019s passing, TGC co-founder Don Carson said, \u201cLike an Old Testament prophet, Tim didn\u2019t hesitate to address the culture and the nation and to call for justice as well as for contrition. He was jealous for the glory of God. He was quick to see how the trajectories of Scripture, the structure of biblical theology, drove thoughtful readers, again and again, back to the gospel.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early 2000s, Keller played a significant role in the revival of Reformed theology commonly called \u201cnew Calvinism,\u201d chronicled by Collin Hansen, TGC vice president of content and editor in chief, in his 2006 book, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Young-Restless-Reformed-Collin-Hansen\/dp\/1581349408\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young, Restless, Reformed<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Crossway).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTim\u2019s loss is not only felt as our leader but especially as our friend and example,\u201d said Hansen, who recently published <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/timothykellerbook\/purchase\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timothy Keller: His Spiritual and Intellectual Formation<\/span><\/i><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Zondervan, 2023) and is the executive director of TGC\u2019s newly launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/thekellercenter\/\">Keller Center for Cultural Apologetics<\/a>. \u201cHe would no doubt encourage us to look to Christ for comfort and share the good news of the gospel with urgency for our lost world. We grieve with his many friends and urge Christians to join us in prayer for his wife, Kathy, and sons, along with their families.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2021, Keller <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lifeandbooksandeverything.sounder.fm\/episode\/27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spoke on a podcast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Hansen, Kevin DeYoung, and Justin Taylor about his experience with terminal cancer and how it has focused his spiritual life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think the way I handle imminent death,\u201d Keller said, \u201cis by fighting my sin and getting deeper communion with God. That\u2019s certainly how John Owen did it, as you know. His <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meditations-Discourses-Glory-Christ-John\/dp\/1502303469\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditations and Discourses on the Glory of Christ<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the last thing he wrote, was basically how he was dealing with his imminent death. And that&#8217;s what I\u2019m trying to do too.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keller often shared tidbits of Owen\u2019s 17th-century wisdom on Twitter, including <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/timkellernyc\/status\/1536023071445946368\">this quote<\/a> from Owen\u2019s commentary on Hebrews: \u201cWe are never nearer Christ than when we find ourselves lost in a holy amazement at his unspeakable love.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keller\u2019s \u201choly amazement\u201d in this life was contagious and catalytic\u2014and will bear fruit for the kingdom long after his death. We rejoice that our dear brother is now in the presence of Christ, more aware and amazed than ever before of his unspeakable love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Tim Keller Tribute\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3-pFsQnYFXY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For media inquiries or quotes from TGC leaders about Tim Keller, please contact Brett McCracken at brett.mccracken@thegospelcoalition.org<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>A giant has left us. It is right and good that we should reflect on some of the things we\u2019ve learned from him. His passing will call forth careful, informed obituaries, but this isn\u2019t one of them. My more modest aim is to share a few memories so that Tim, like Abel, \u201cstill speaks, even though he is dead\u201d (Heb. 11:3, NIV).<\/p>\n<p>Before we met face-to-face, Tim and I collaborated on a book project. Under the title <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Worship-Book-R-Kent-Hughes\/dp\/0310216257\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Worship by the Book<\/em><\/a>, a group of pastors from different denominational backgrounds but all deeply committed to expository ministry wrote long chapters outlining what they thought corporate worship should look like, including sample services. Tim was our Presbyterian. About the time the book appeared (in 2002), Tim and I finally got together\u2014first in London, where we were both speaking at the same conference, and then in New York. On the latter occasion, I was in Princeton for something or other, and Tim suggested I take the fast train into the city, where we enjoyed lunch at a sidewalk caf\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally you meet a person with whom you form an instant bond. Tim was that kind of friend. Our conversations never faltered, as if we had to fumble around to find something to talk about. Theology, the state of the church, the strengths and failures of confessional evangelicalism, the urgent need for more expository preaching, analysis of current cultural and other trends in America and elsewhere, the meaning of certain biblical passages, spiritual disciplines\u2014all of this and more captured our conversations, with time also allotted to our families.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Theology, the state of the church, expository preaching, current cultural trends, the meaning of certain biblical passages, spiritual disciplines\u2014all of this and more captured our conversations.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I don\u2019t think we ever talked about Wimbledon, the PGA Tour, the World Series, the Stanley Cup, or any of their cousins. Because Tim and Kathy lived in an apartment throughout their New York years, his conversation rarely strayed into gardens, birdsong, and flowers (contrast C. H. Spurgeon!). He never had a \u201cHoney, do\u201d list dictated by the backyard. Very often we talked about evangelism. About a dozen years ago, we got on the phone to compare notes: he had just returned from a mission at Oxford University, and I from Melbourne, Australia. This vista\u2014how to become more fruitful in evangelism\u2014was one of many fronts where he was far more gifted than I.<\/p>\n<p>And that brings us to his formidably fruitful quarter-century in New York City. Many preachers have built megachurches; relatively few have done so with conversion growth in a highly secular and urban environment steeped in biblical illiteracy. Characteristically, Tim\u2019s sermons were expository in shape and design: his first priority was to explain the text of Scripture. His textual unit was customarily a paragraph, a pericope, or a chapter, not a half-verse or an esoteric expression. He had an uncommon ability to tell old truths in a fresh way. Part of this was achieved by the space and energy he poured into his application of the text. Here he addressed not only individual sins and individual needs, but large-scale moral and cultural trends. Like an Old Testament prophet, he didn\u2019t hesitate to address the culture and the nation and to call for justice as well as for contrition. He was jealous for the glory of God. He was quick to see how the trajectories of Scripture, the structure of biblical theology, drove thoughtful readers, again and again, back to the gospel. His preaching taught people how to read their Bibles. Although his New York congregation was largely well educated, his sermons were accessible to a broader range of people\u2014doubtless the product of preaching for almost a dozen years in a somewhat less sophisticated congregation.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Like an Old Testament prophet, he didn\u2019t hesitate to address the culture and the nation and to call for justice as well as for contrition. He was jealous for the glory of God.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>His reading habits were prodigious. He found time to peruse many books on social analysis and current affairs, but he also devoured historical theology, commentaries, and broader literature. For a period of time, he worked his way (again!) through Calvin\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Calvin-Institutes-Christian-Religion-1960-01-01\/dp\/B017PNVM06\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Institutes<\/em><\/a> as part of his daily discipline. Anyone who heard him preach recognized how thoroughly he had digested C. S. Lewis\u2014not because he wanted to mimic Lewis\u2019s theology, but to learn from his images, his use of language, and his winsome apologetics. And all of this was set within the framework of his commitment to the Westminster Confession.<\/p>\n<p>Some of his followers failed to see this: they were attracted to his cultural analysis and didn\u2019t always discern how deeply his preaching was tethered to historic confessionalism. And all of this was allowed to marinate in a humble piety: his sermons were never so cerebral that arguments were allowed to displace confession, prayer, and a deep sense of the presence of God. Nowhere did this strand of Tim\u2019s life and ministry become more poignant and penetrating than in the last years of his life when he was fighting cancer.<\/p>\n<p>Most people who spent time with Tim thought they were among his best friends. Like the apostle John, who thought of himself as the one whom Jesus loved, not a few of Tim\u2019s parishioners thought of themselves as particularly loved by their senior pastor. That is a common mark of a well-cared-for church. It\u2019s also a measure of a pastor who never loses his cool: not once did I ever see Tim on the verge of \u201closing it,\u201d still less of descending to catty or condescending assessments of others. More broadly, a large part of Tim\u2019s attractiveness in his apologetic preaching turned on his ability to summarize an opponent\u2019s argument with more accuracy and evenhandedness than the opponent could. The temptation to score points among one\u2019s acolytes sometimes destroys our ability to win over an opponent. That is a pitfall into which I\u2019ve never seen Tim stumble\u2014not once. I wish I could make the same claim about myself.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>His sermons were never so cerebral that arguments were allowed to displace confession, prayer, and a deep sense of the presence of God.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The same self-discipline and Christian courtesy invariably showed up amid controversy. The initial Council of what became The Gospel Coalition first met in 2005. Tim was asked to draft a document that we called our Theological Vision of Ministry (TVM). That proto-Council was made up of about 40 pastors, most of whom were strong-minded people with firm opinions about what changes should be introduced to our TVM. When one\u2019s work is challenged, it\u2019s very easy to retreat into irritable defensiveness, but I never saw a hint of it in Tim. One brother came in with 50 suggested improvements. Tim and this brother went through them one by one. In most cases Tim cheerfully acknowledged that the suggested change was an improvement, and thanked his critic for it. That attitude also gained him the credibility to push back, gently but firmly, when he felt the brother\u2019s suggestion weakened the document\u2014and in such cases he won the critic over. This exercise was not only important for the improving of TVM (and other documents) but became the hallmark of how we operated: we could and did disagree about many things, yet we learned from one another. The Council members became trusted friends; we spent a lot of time listening to and praying for one another. Half a dozen times, Tim said the TGC Council meeting was his favorite meeting of the year. A big part of the pull was the quality of the relationships that Tim\u2019s own interactions had helped to train into the meetings.<\/p>\n<p>A good sense of humor helps. During our second Council meeting (in 2006), Tim, who was sitting next to me, burst into a quiet chuckle and turned the screen of his laptop to me so that I could see it. Apparently in the course of discussion of some theological point or other, Tim had said something that surprised another Council member. That Council member sent an email to one of his assistants and summarized what Tim had said. The assistant posted it online: \u201cTim Keller has just said such-and-such.\u201d One of Tim\u2019s assistants spotted it online and fired off an email to his boss, still seated beside me: \u201cDid you really say that?\u201d The substance of what Tim had said took just under 15 minutes to get back to him. A lesser man would have been offended by what appeared to be a breach of confidence, but Tim thought it was funny.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, we tightened up our commitments to privacy: what is said in our Council meetings is to stay in our Council meetings. (I\u2019m not aware of any time in subsequent years when this simple rule was broken.) But Tim\u2019s chuckle, shared with the group, helped us negotiate the moment. Tim was not much for telling jokes for the sake of telling jokes\u2014but he had a very fine sense of the ridiculous.<\/p>\n<p>It would be wrong for me to wrap up this memoir without saying something about Kathy, or, more precisely, Tim\u2019s regard for Kathy. Of the many, many times when I have heard him preach, only very rarely has he completed the sermon without slipping in a reference to his wife. The same is true about my private conversations with Tim: it was unusual not to hear him spell out what Kathy thought or narrate something from her own experiences of grace and of ministry. Never, not once, did I hear a slighting comment about her, even in jest. Simply put, Tim loved and cherished his wife, and everyone knew it. They grew closer across the decades, and never more so than when Tim began to slide into his final illness. I am surely not the only one to whom Tim confided that during that illness, he and Kathy wept together more than they ever had and never loved each other more.<\/p>\n<p>We have lost a giant.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>\u201cI have some sad news to share,\u201d a subdued voice told me over the phone. \u201cHarry Reeder died in a car accident this morning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That was the call I got from my friend yesterday afternoon. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d just seen Harry two weeks ago at the Gospel Reformation Network conference here in Charlotte, North Carolina. I was going to see Harry again in a few weeks, if I didn\u2019t talk to him before then, at the PCA General Assembly. How could this be true? Did this really happen? Is Harry really gone? That was my response, and it was the same response I got from members of my congregation as I shared with them the tragic news that their beloved former pastor had passed on to glory.<\/p>\n<p>I suppose everyone is unique, but Harry truly was unlike anyone I&#8217;ve ever met. He was a powerful preacher\u2014authoritative and gregarious, big in personality and passionate about the gospel, funny and blood earnest all at the same time. But he wasn&#8217;t just a gifted preacher and teacher. He was also an amazingly conscientious pastor\u2014never forgetting a name, learning all he could about his flock, and constantly following up on church members. As everyone who knew Harry can attest, he seemed to possess indefatigable energy, not to mention a filing cabinet in his brain that could produce sermon outlines, the movements of Civil War regiments, and alliterative insights seemingly at will.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, Harry was a man\u2019s man: strong, athletic, and confident. But he was also a family man. We should pray for his wife, Cindy, along with their three children\u2014Jennifer, Ike, and Abby\u2014and their many grandchildren. Harry will be greatly missed by thousands, but especially by his family. I&#8217;ll miss him as a Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) founding father, as a ministerial example, and as a friend.<\/p>\n<h3>Harry\u2019s Pastoral Imprint<\/h3>\n<p>Hardly a week goes by that I don\u2019t hear firsthand about Harry Reeder\u2019s ministry. Though Harry left Christ Covenant, where I now serve as senior pastor, almost 25 years ago, the church still bears his imprint. Under the Lord Jesus, it\u2019s Harry Reeder\u2019s church.<\/p>\n<p>When Christ Covenant particularized as a congregation on December 5, 1981, the church had fewer than 40 members and no pastor. At the time, Harry was leading a flourishing work at Pinelands Presbyterian Church in Miami, Florida. The PCA\u2014less than a decade old\u2014wanted to establish a flagship church in Charlotte. The aim was to plant a church that would plant a presbytery. Not surprisingly, the denomination wanted Harry to return to his hometown and plant this kind of church.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Harry will be greatly missed by thousands, but especially by his family. I&#8217;ll miss him as a PCA founding father, as a ministerial example, and as a friend.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Harry was interested, but he soon discovered there was already a small PCA church in Charlotte, and Harry didn\u2019t want to plant a rival church to one that already existed. This humble hesitancy was all the encouragement Christ Covenant needed to aggressively pursue Harry to become its senior pastor. In February 1983, Harry and Cindy moved to Charlotte and began their ministry at Christ Covenant.<\/p>\n<p>Harry left a thriving church of 400 for a church plant in a trailer. But almost immediately, the church began to grow\u2014tripling in the first three months, outgrowing their facilities the same year, adding a second service in 1987, moving into their first owned building in 1988, doubling again three years later, starting a Christian school in 1989, and then breaking ground in 1994 on the worship center where I now have the privilege of preaching each Sunday. By the time Christ Covenant moved into its permanent home in 1997, the church had swelled to 3,000 members, almost half of whom were children.<\/p>\n<p>In 1999, Harry left Christ Covenant to become the senior pastor at Briarwood Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama. It may have been the only church that could\u2019ve lured Harry away from the congregation and the city he dearly loved. Briarwood isn&#8217;t only a very large and generous church\u2014it&#8217;s also the mothership of the PCA, the place where the denomination began on December 4, 1973. Following Frank Barker at Briarwood was no small task, but Harry and Frank supported and encouraged each other admirably during the transition and over their many years together in Birmingham. For almost a quarter century, Harry preached the Bible\u2014faithfully, fruitfully, forcefully\u2014in what is one of our denomination\u2019s most important and influential congregations.<\/p>\n<h3>Harry\u2019s Faithful Mentorship<\/h3>\n<p>For many ministers my age and younger, Harry became an implicit, and sometimes explicit, mentor. Like hundreds of others over the years, I traipsed across Civil War battlefields with Harry as he passed along the stories and leadership lessons he loved to share. He wasn\u2019t shy about stating his opinions, but he also was generous in passing out encouragement. Many pastors looked up to him for his theological clarity, his moral courage, and his resolute commitment to the \u201cold paths\u201d of preaching, sacraments, and prayer.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Many pastors looked up to him for his theological clarity, his moral courage, and his resolute commitment to the \u2018old paths\u2019 of preaching, sacraments, and prayer.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The PCA will celebrate its 50th anniversary in Memphis next month as commissioners from all over the country gather for General Assembly. I can hardly believe we won\u2019t see Harry there.<\/p>\n<p>As well as anyone I\u2019ve known, Harry embodied the motto of the PCA: \u201cFaithful to the Scriptures, true to the Reformed Faith, obedient to the Great Commission.\u201d That was Harry\u2014all of him and all of it. He loved to teach the faith, he loved to defend the faith, and he loved to share his faith. I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t the only person to see Harry witness to the restaurant server or ask perfect strangers how he could pray for them.<\/p>\n<p>Above all, Harry\u2019s legacy is the gospel he preached so effectively and shared so frequently. For Harry, all is glory and gladness now and forever. For those he knew here on earth, there&#8217;ll be grief and sadness. But if Harry\u2019s word can be believed\u2014no, if <em>God\u2019s<\/em> Word can be believed\u2014then we don&#8217;t mourn as those who have no hope. We have heard the joyful sound: Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<\/p>\n",

The longtime worship leader at Cahaba Park Church in Birmingham, Wright has said his \u201clife-long pursuit is setting Scripture to music,\u201d creating \u201ca resource to help God\u2019s people engage and treasure the Bible more deeply.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Through eight musical volumes, each setting to music verbatim Scripture from the ESV Bible, Wright is doing just that.

I pray these beautiful tracks help root the words of Jesus in your heart and soul in new ways.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>John 3:16\u201317<\/h4>\n<p>This passage is one of the most known and beloved verses in all of Scripture, communicating the gospel in a simple way. I wanted the music to reflect that simplicity and chose a melody that was easy for anyone to sing (my congregation sings this corporately on a regular basis). For the final line in the song, I chose to hold out the word \u201ceternal\u201d to emphasize the everlasting glory that awaits us with our Father in heaven.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"The Corner Room - &quot;John 3:16-17&quot; (Lyric Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/lIb22SMVjTg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>Matthew 5:3\u201312<\/h4>\n<p>My favorite albums are those that don\u2019t stick to the same \u201csound\u201d or genre, and this preference definitely carries over into the music I create. I love acoustic music and had to apply the \u201cbluegrass filter\u201d to this text. We can draw great comfort (and joy!) from acknowledging that the qualities contained in the Beatitudes are things God works <i>in us<\/i>, not a list of things we can accomplish on our own. The ending of this passage is what solidified the upbeat, fun nature of the arrangement: \u201cRejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"The Corner Room - &quot;Matthew 5:3-12&quot; (Lyric Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/R5BtKKUq13k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>Matthew 11:28\u201330<\/h4>\n<p>A few years ago I read <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Gentle-Lowly-Christ-Sinners-Sufferers\/dp\/1433566133\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Gentle and Lowly<\/i><\/a> by Dane Ortlund, and I highly recommend it. His commentary on this passage radically challenged and shaped the way I perceived my \u201crightness\u201d before Jesus. Ortlund writes,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">You don&#8217;t need to unburden or collect yourself and then come to Jesus. Your very burden is what qualifies you to come. No payment is required; he says, \u201cI will <i>give<\/i> you rest.\u201d His rest is gift, not transaction.<\/p>\n<p>The tenderness of the beautiful invitation molded the musical setting I wrote for this passage.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"The Corner Room - &quot;Matthew 11:28-30&quot; (Lyric Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qOC_IM4aB2I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>John 17:1\u201311<\/h4>\n<p>This passage was definitely my favorite to set to music. This prayer of Jesus helps us to see his \u201cheartbeat,\u201d revealing an extended look at the intimacy between God the Father and God the Son. I wanted the music to reflect a growing intensity as Jesus prays, singularly focused on the glory of the Father reflected in the redemption of his people. The vocal and guitar ending on the same note at the end was meant to emphasize union with Christ (\u201cThat they may be one, even as we are one,\u201d v. 11).<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"The Corner Room - &quot;John 17:1-11&quot; (Lyric Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xHVFEMF3zys?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>John 21:15\u201319<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cDo you love me more than these?\u201d This is a difficult question to consider and causes us to evaluate our faithfulness to love and serve Jesus and his people. Musically, I wanted to create space and repetition for the listener. I love Jesus&#8217;s final command, &#8220;Follow me,&#8221; reminding us dependency on and communion with him are the fuel we need to obey the first three commands.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"The Corner Room - &quot;John 21:15-19&quot; (Lyric Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qcPtGGhLloI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>Matthew 28:18\u201320<\/h4>\n<p>This melody came together quickly, but I had a difficult time deciding whether or not to make the music feel bigger and more ethereal. On the one hand, Jesus\u2019s final words before his ascension seemed to call for a more dramatic approach; but on the other, the small gathering with his now 11 disciples\u2014imparting final instructions and promises\u2014warranted simplicity. I opted to keep it more intimate and rely on three vocal harmonies to emphasize portions of the text and to bring out a more Trinitarian voice.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"The Corner Room - &quot;Matthew 28:18-20&quot; (Lyric Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IRLMWLmZh5E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">We rightly expect our pastors to spend hours preparing before they preach on Sundays. But what should the people in the pew be doing? How can God\u2019s people prepare to receive the message the preacher has prepared? <\/span><\/p>\n<p>While reading through Acts, I noticed a pattern of preparation tucked away in chapter 10. When Peter arrived to preach the gospel to Cornelius, he was welcomed with these words: &#8220;I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord&#8221;\u202f(Acts 10:33).<\/p>\n<p>Cornelius displays the desire we ought to have as we wait on God\u2019s Word to be delivered to us. We can prepare our hearts for preaching by cultivating five characteristics.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Eagerness to Hear from God<\/h4>\n<p>As soon as Cornelius heard from the angel that God had a message for him, he \u201csent for [Peter]\u202fat once\u201d (v. 33). When Peter arrived, Cornelius had been expectantly looking for him, longing to hear more about this God he feared and worshiped (vv. 2,\u202f24).\u202fCornelius said the audience was ready to hear everything Peter had been \u201ccommanded by the Lord.\u201d He understood that while Peter was the messenger, the message was from God.<\/p>\n<p>When you sit under the teaching or preaching of God\u2019s Word, are you more easily impressed with the speaker than affected by the God who&#8217;s speaking through his Word? Do you long to hear a message from God through this messenger? If not, confess your lack of longing to God and ask him to give you a heart that\u2019s eager to hear his voice.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Gratitude for the Messenger<\/h4>\n<p>Cornelius knew the difficulties Peter endured to deliver God\u2019s message to him, traveling an arduous 30 miles from Joppa to Caesarea. He appreciated Peter&#8217;s willingness to faithfully obey God against what the religious leaders taught about association with Gentiles (v. 28). As a man of and under authority, Cornelius recognized he and Peter were under God\u2019s authority and wanted to hear \u201call that [Peter had] been commanded by the Lord.\u201d Cornelius also trusted that Peter\u2019s preaching came from a heart of love for him, so he commended Peter for being \u201ckind enough to come\u201d (v. 33).<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s your attitude toward the messenger\u2014the teacher or preacher\u2014you&#8217;ll hear bringing God\u2019s Word?\u202fAre you grateful for the time and sacrifice the messenger has invested in preparing?\u202fDo you respect the preacher as one who speaks on behalf of the Lord? Do you receive the preaching as an act of kindness to you?<\/p>\n<h4>3. Commitment to Community<\/h4>\n<blockquote><p>Do you respect the preacher as one who speaks on behalf of the Lord? Do you receive the preaching as an act of kindness to you?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Cornelius was attentive to the others around him who also gathered to hear from God. As the head of the household and the one who received the angel\u2019s message, Cornelius could have asked for a private audience with Peter. But he wanted everyone in his sphere of influence to hear the message, so he gathered his family and friends (v. 24). Cornelius showed he wasn\u2019t concerned only for what God had for him but also for what he had for others.<\/p>\n<p>Do you listen to God\u2019s Word in the context of a community?\u202fDo you pursue others with whom you can learn from it? Do you invite others to sit under the Word with you? Do you pray for your church friends and family as they hear it preached?<\/p>\n<h4>4. Attention to God\u2019s Presence<\/h4>\n<p>Cornelius was aware he and his fellow hearers were together \u201cin the presence of God\u201d (v. 33).\u202fWhen you sit under Bible teaching and preaching, are you attentive to and pursuing God\u2019s presence? Do you practice the presence of God by praying throughout the teaching time, asking God to speak to you and to give you ears to &#8220;hear what the Spirit says to the churches\u201d (Rev. 2:7)?<\/p>\n<h4>5. Readiness to Hear and Do<\/h4>\n<p>Cornelius said he and his household were ready to hear \u201call\u201d Peter had to say to them (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.esv.org\/verses\/Acts%2010%3A33\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.esv.org\/verses\/Acts%252010%253A33\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684323372446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3D13nhbzAAB8BvZbWFol5j\">Acts 10:33<\/a>). This kind of listening requires active attentiveness that seeks to receive and understand the whole message, including each individual part of the whole. <span style=\"font-family: Charter;\">Cornelius was \u201cno hearer who forgets but a doer who acts\u201d (James 1:22\u201324). He put the preaching immediately into practice by believing the gospel and being baptized (Acts 10:47\u201348). Spurgeon once <a href=\"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/spurgeon\/sermons05\/sermons05.xv.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told<\/a> his congregation of a Scottish woman who rightly quipped on her way out of church, &#8220;The sermon has been said, but it is not yet done.&#8221; The best way to hear preaching is to be ready to do it as soon as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Do you employ the means necessary\u2014taking notes, turning off your phone\u2014to hear the whole message?\u202fDo you try to understand both the overall flow and the individual parts of the message? What do you need to do to overcome distractions? Are you willing to hear everything God might be saying to you, or are you prone to selective hearing? Do you respond to the sermon with fresh faith in God, repentance for sin, and plans to love and serve the people God gives you? What steps will you need to take to be a doer of the word on Monday, not just a hearer on Sunday?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Are you willing to hear everything God might be saying to you, or are you prone to selective hearing?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Sincere followers of Jesus struggle to hear preaching with prepared hearts. The preacher\u2019s imperfect delivery, those noisy kids down the row, spiritual warfare, and so many other factors hinder our hearing. What might happen if we learn from Cornelius and practice these five ways to prepare our hearts for preaching?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s pray that God would grant us the same measure of grace he gave Cornelius and his household that day: \u201cWhile Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word\u201d (v. 44). Can you imagine the glory and grace that would fall on churches full of hearts ready to hear and heed all the good news the Lord has given preachers to deliver?<\/p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Earlier this month, India overtook China as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/development\/desa\/dpad\/publication\/un-desa-policy-brief-no-153-india-overtakes-china-as-the-worlds-most-populous-country\/#:~:text=UN%20DESA%20Policy%20Brief%20No,the%20world's%20most%20populous%20country&amp;text=Department%20of%20Economic%20and%20Social%20Affairs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">world\u2019s most populous country<\/a>. Christians make up only 2.4 percent of India&#8217;s massive population, but the sheer number of believers is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.christianitytoday.com\/ct\/2016\/november\/incredible-india-christianity-special-report-christward-mov.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">still sizable enough<\/a> to rank it among the 25 countries with the most Christians, surpassing \u201cChristian countries\u201d such as Uganda and Greece.<\/p>\n<p>Christianity in India, though not as widely practiced as Hinduism or Islam, has a rich and intriguing history that dates back almost 2,000 years. Its origins, influence, and contributions to Indian society are profound, albeit lesser known. Here are nine things you should know about Christianity in India.<\/p>\n<h4>1. The \u2018doubting disciple\u2019 is said to have spread the faith to India.<\/h4>\n<p>Christianity&#8217;s arrival in India is traditionally attributed to the apostle Thomas, one of the original 12 disciples of Jesus. According to a popular tradition, Thomas traveled to the Malabar Coast, a region on the southwest side of the subcontinent. It was in this area he&#8217;s said to have established seven churches, laying the groundwork for a community known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/Thomas-Christians\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thomas Christians<\/a> or Syrian Christians. This Christian community is among the oldest in the world and refutes the argument that Indian Christianity is merely a product of Western colonial influence.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Christian missionary efforts have been influential for over 400 years.<\/h4>\n<p>The history of Christianity in India is deeply intertwined with the saga of Christian missions. The missionary fervor of the European colonial era, in particular, marked a pivotal phase in Indian Christianity&#8217;s history. Catholic missionaries from Portugal arrived in the 16th century, establishing Jesuit missions and introducing the Roman Catholic faith to new regions. Other colonial powers, including the British, Dutch, and Danish, sent Protestant missionaries who established churches and expanded the influence of the faith. This effort came from different denominations, including Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist missions.<\/p>\n<p>Most prominent among these missionaries was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/william-carey-at-250\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">William Carey<\/a>, a British Baptist missionary who arrived in Serampore, Bengal, in 1793. Carey, along with his colleagues Joshua Marshman and William Ward, made significant contributions to education, social reform, and the development of regional languages. Their work, known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/mahasoe.com\/2020\/11\/10\/serampore-mission\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Serampore Mission<\/a>, set the tone for future Protestant missions in India.<\/p>\n<h4>3. The \u2018father of modern missions\u2019 transformed Indian languages.<\/h4>\n<p>Christian missionaries not only spread their faith but also transformed Indian vernacular languages. Their efforts to translate the Bible into various Indian languages led to the standardization of grammar and vocabulary, effectively helping to mold these languages.<\/p>\n<p>In 1801, Carey was entrusted with the task of teaching Bengali, Sanskrit, and Marathi at Fort William College. His linguistic proficiency led him to translate the Bible into multiple languages, including Bengali, Oriya, Marathi, Hindi, Assamese, and Sanskrit. He worked on translating parts of the Bible into 29 other languages and dialects. Alongside Marshman, he edited a Bhotia grammar book and developed grammars for six other languages. Carey and Marshman also created dictionaries for Bengali, Sanskrit, and Marathi and undertook the colossal task of translating three volumes of the epic Sanskrit poem <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/Ramayana-Indian-epic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Ramayana<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>4. Christian missionaries made significant contributions to Indian education.<\/h4>\n<p>Missionaries founded some of the earliest modern educational institutions in India, including schools, colleges, and universities. These institutions offered a previously unavailable Western-style education. Institutions like <a href=\"https:\/\/xaviers.ac\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">St. Xavier\u2019s College<\/a> in Mumbai, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loyolacollege.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Loyola College<\/a> in Chennai, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ststephens.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">St. Stephen&#8217;s College<\/a> in Delhi were established by Christian missionaries and continue to be recognized for academic excellence. At a time when education for women wasn&#8217;t given importance, Christian missionaries played a crucial role in promoting women&#8217;s education in India. They established numerous schools for girls, advocating for gender equality and challenging societal norms.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Missionaries sparked social reform throughout society.<\/h4>\n<p>Missionaries established schools in remote areas and provided education for marginalized communities, including lower-caste groups and tribals, who were often denied education in mainstream society. This was a significant step toward inclusivity and social reform. The missionaries actively campaigned against social malpractices such as the caste system, untouchability, child marriage, and Sati, a ritual where a widow would self-immolate on her husband&#8217;s funeral pyre.<\/p>\n<p>Missionaries provided support for widows and outcast women, who were often marginalized in society. They set up shelters and homes, providing these women with a safe refuge and the means to earn a living. Christians advocated for the rights of women and encouraged them to take active roles in the church, including as educators, health workers, and evangelists. This was an important step toward empowering women and promoting their active participation in public life.<\/p>\n<h4>6. Christianity has influenced Indian art, literature, and architecture.<\/h4>\n<p>Christianity in India has adapted to local cultures and traditions, resulting in a unique blend of Indian and Christian practices. This integration is evident in the architecture of churches, liturgical music, and local customs. For instance, in Kerala, the tradition of \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puthen_Pana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Puthen Pana<\/a>\u201d involves singing a narrative poem about the life of Jesus during the Holy Week. Indian authors have written novels and short stories that explore Christian themes and the experiences of Christian characters. A prominent example is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/God-Small-Things-Novel\/dp\/0812979656\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The God of Small Things<\/em><\/a> by Arundhati Roy, which delves into the lives of a Christian family in Kerala, exploring themes of caste, love, and social transformation.<\/p>\n<p>India has numerous Christian landmarks, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/travel\/destinations\/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-basilica-of-bom-jesus-in-goa\/articleshow\/92691434.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Basilica of Bom Jesus<\/a> in Goa, which holds the remains of Francis Xavier. The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Parangimalai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">St. Thomas Mount<\/a> in Chennai, believed to be the place where the apostle Thomas was martyred, is another significant religious site.<\/p>\n<h4>7. Christianity in India is regionally and denominationally diverse.<\/h4>\n<p>Although Christianity is spread across the country, South India is home to about half of the Christians in the country, with a particularly vibrant Christian community <a href=\"https:\/\/www.christiancentury.org\/article\/notes-global-church\/vibrant-christianity-south-india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in the southern states<\/a>. In the more sparsely populated Northeast, Christians make up a relatively large share of the population, with the vast majority belonging to tribal communities. Christian populations can also be found in other parts of India, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.state.gov\/reports\/2021-report-on-international-religious-freedom\/india\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Goa<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, the concentration of Christians varies from one region to another, depending on factors such as the prevailing rite and tradition and the length of time Christianity has existed in those regions. The ancient Thomas Christians of Kerala, for example, have a distinctive culture compared to Christians in other parts of the country. While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/short-reads\/2021\/07\/12\/8-key-findings-about-christians-in-india\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many Indian Christians<\/a> identify as Catholic (37 percent), a variety of other denominations are present in India. For example, 13 percent of Indian Christians are Baptists, 7 percent identify with the Church of North India, and another 7 percent identify with the Church of South India.<\/p>\n<h4>8. A substantial portion of Indian Christians engage in syncretism.<\/h4>\n<p>Religious syncretism, the merging of different and often incompatible faith traditions, is an all-too-common practice in India (just as it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/new-age-beliefs-common-america-common-churches\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in the U.S.<\/a>). A significant portion of Indian Christians incorporates beliefs and practices from other religions, with a majority (54 percent) believing in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/9-more-things-about-hinduism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concept of karma<\/a>. Many Indian Christians believe in reincarnation (29 percent) and ascribe purifying powers to the Ganges River (32 percent), both of which are fundamental beliefs in Hinduism. It&#8217;s not uncommon for Indian Christians to participate in customs associated with other religions, such as celebrating the festival of Diwali (31 percent) or adorning a bindi on the forehead (22 percent), a practice typically observed by Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain women.<\/p>\n<h4>9. Persecution remains a persistent threat.<\/h4>\n<p>Religious persecution of Christians in India has been on the rise in recent years, with Hindu extremist groups, local governments, and nationalist Hindus seeking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.persecution.com\/globalprayerguide\/india\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;purify&#8221; India by making it entirely Hindu<\/a>. These persecutors view Christian converts as traitors to the Hindu homeland and aim to eliminate them to appease Hindu deities. Christians in India face <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/12\/22\/world\/asia\/india-christians-attacked.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">various forms of persecution<\/a>, including attacks on churches, arrests, and detention on false charges of forced conversions. For example, Hindu-nationalist informants in many villages report on the activities of Christians, leading to attacks and arrests. In some cases, Christians have been forced out of their villages, and hundreds have been jailed for practicing their faith.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.opendoorsuk.org\/news\/latest-news\/india-protests-persecution\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anti-conversion laws<\/a> in several Indian states have further fueled the persecution and are often a pretext for attacks on Christians, who are accused of trying to convert Hindus to Christianity. Despite constitutional protections for freedom of religion, the act of worship has become dangerous for many Christians in India who remain resilient and faithful despite persecution.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>There\u2019s a fist-shaped hole in the door of my childhood bedroom. It was there when my mom and I moved in, and I\u2019d soon learn it portended what my stepfather could do. Even writing this, more than two decades after moving away, I still feel fear.<\/p>\n<p>My stepdad was a deacon in our local church and well respected in the community. He led more people to Jesus than I ever have or likely will. His explosive anger never reached outside the home, so perhaps it makes sense why our church leadership thought I was a rebellious teenager making trouble and gossiping about a \u201cgodly\u201d man.<\/p>\n<p>I left home before I graduated from high school, and then just before college, Christ called me to himself. I had a lot of anger built up from those years with my stepdad, and I definitely wasn\u2019t ready to forgive. Over the next few years, Jesus taught me to love my enemies in a most unexpected way\u2014through praying the imprecatory psalms.<\/p>\n<h3>Impreca-what?<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cImprecation\u201d is a fancy way of saying \u201ccurse,\u201d and an imprecatory psalm is a \u201ccursing psalm.\u201d We see imprecatory prayers regularly in the Bible, such as when Nehemiah utters a more refined version of \u201cI\u2019m rubber and you\u2019re glue\u201d: \u201cTurn back their taunt on their own heads and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives. Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out from your sight, for they have provoked you to anger in the presence of the builders.\u201d (Neh. 4:4\u20135).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;Imprecation&#8217; is a fancy way of saying &#8216;curse,&#8217; and an imprecatory psalm is a &#8216;cursing psalm.&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Paul wasn\u2019t averse to issuing curses either: \u201cIf anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed\u201d (1 Cor. 16:22). And even Jesus issued \u201cwoes\u201d upon the scribes and Pharisees (Matt. 23) and upon Judas (26:23\u201324).<\/p>\n<p>Note Nehemiah prayed against Sanballat and Tobiah, infamous antagonists of God\u2019s people in Jerusalem. Paul prayed against those who turn away from God, and Jesus aimed his woes at arguably the vilest people in the Gospels. If we&#8217;re inclined to think of a &#8220;curse&#8221; as a personal vendetta, the imprecatory psalms reorient our understanding. Imprecatory psalms aren&#8217;t petty prayers. These \u201ccursing psalms\u201d are \u201cjustice psalms,\u201d prayers that God would do what he\u2019s promised: judge righteously on the earth.<\/p>\n<h3>Justice for the Vulnerable<\/h3>\n<p>Tucked into a long series of laws meant to govern the newly formed nation of Israel is a passage with important insight into God\u2019s concern for the weak and vulnerable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">You shall not wrong a sojourner or oppress him, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. You shall not mistreat any widow or fatherless child. If you do mistreat them, and they cry out to me, I will surely hear their cry, and my wrath will burn, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless. (Ex. 22:21\u201324)<\/p>\n<p>The Lord doesn\u2019t say he will rebuke the vulnerable for crying out against their enemies; rather, he says he\u2019ll \u201csurely hear their cry\u201d and respond in judgment. Strong words from the Creator of the universe.<\/p>\n<p>In the surrounding nations, the three groups of people the Lord mentions here\u2014sojourners, widows, and the fatherless\u2014would all have lacked a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.writtenforus.fathomcolumns.com\/post\/leave-your-father-s-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">family head<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.writtenforus.fathomcolumns.com\/post\/what-is-a-kinsman-redeemer-in-ruth-and-the-rest-of-the-old-testament\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kinsman redeemer<\/a> to protect them. They would have been utterly alone in societies where the \u201csafety net\u201d consisted exclusively of kinship ties. But by making this law, God established Israel as a different kind of society, one that protected the weak. And if his people failed to keep the law, God promised to defend the weak himself.<\/p>\n<h3>Justice Rooted in God\u2019s Word<\/h3>\n<p>Other passages in Scripture likewise demonstrate God\u2019s just character. We see his justice in Genesis 3 with the serpent, Adam, and Eve; in Genesis 6 with the flood; and in Genesis 11 with the scattering at Babel. In Genesis 18, Abraham appeals to God\u2019s justice in his prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah: \u201cShall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?\u201d (v. 25). Psalm 58 concludes with the answer to Abraham\u2019s question: \u201cSurely there is a God who judges on earth\u201d (v. 11).<\/p>\n<p>Lest we think justice is only an Old Testament concept, the apostle Paul argues that God\u2019s justice was at work on the cross, offering \u201cgrace as a gift . . . to show God\u2019s righteousness [justice], because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.\u201d And why did he pass over former sins? \u201cTo show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus\u201d (Rom. 3:24\u201326).<\/p>\n<p>Praying for justice, then, is rooted in Scripture, where we see three ways God demonstrates his justice. First, the Lord invites the weak and vulnerable to bring their complaints to him. Second, he\u2019s proven he <i>will<\/i> judge evildoers. Third, he gloriously offers justice poured out at the cross for our salvation.<\/p>\n<h3>Praying for Justice So We Can Love Our Enemies<\/h3>\n<p>God\u2019s justice in the cross brings us to the crux of the issue: Should we curse our enemies? Doesn\u2019t Jesus say to love our enemies?<\/p>\n<p>Even if we think of imprecatory psalms as justice psalms, the fact remains that they <i>are<\/i> prayers for recompense, for comeuppance, for God\u2019s judgment\u2014not often for his forgiveness. But in my experience, crying out for God\u2019s justice when there was no one else to help me freed me to love and not hold a grudge against my stepdad. Rather than carrying around my anger, never allowing the wound to heal, Psalm 58 and Psalm 109 taught me to bring that injustice to the Lord and trust him to act justly (cf. Rom. 12:19).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Crying out for God\u2019s justice when there was no one else to help me freed me to love my stepdad.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To answer the question plainly: yes, Christians today can and should pray imprecatory psalms.<\/p>\n<p>These psalms, with their cries for vengeance and justice, show us mere mortals <i>how<\/i> to relinquish our right to vengeance and trust the Lord. They\u2019re a model for raw, honest prayer that confesses an unyielding and unwavering trust that God is \u201cjust and the justifier\u201d (Rom. 3:26). The Lord gladly hears these prayers, and he\u2019ll answer them in this life or the next. The wrongs done against us are put into perspective when we realize justice is just a matter of time.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>\u201cGod, where are you?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve prayed this desperate prayer through tears more often than I wish to recall. Whether it&#8217;s been sickness in my family, problems in my church, or my brokenheartedness over sin, there have been many moments in my life when God seemed gone. I\u2019m willing to bet you can relate.<\/p>\n<p>At some point in our lives (more likely many points), we&#8217;ll experience a <em>feeling<\/em> about God\u2019s presence that&#8217;s at variance with the <em>facts<\/em>. In moments of pain, trauma, or sadness, our hearts will accuse God of being distant even while our minds remind us God is ever present. The dissonance between facts and feelings, presence and absence\u2014if left unaddressed\u2014can be discouraging at best or destructive to our faith at worst.<\/p>\n<p>So what will you do when God seems gone?<\/p>\n<h3>Facts Alone Make You Stoic<\/h3>\n<p>When my life is falling apart, I reach for the solid footholds of truth. The facts of God\u2019s Word can be immeasurably comforting, as they&#8217;re meant to be. But as one popular podcaster is wont to say, \u201cFacts don\u2019t care about your feelings.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The dissonance between facts and feelings, presence and absence, can be discouraging at best or destructive to our faith at worst.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s a kind of sufferer who simply ignores or represses his emotions. This is one ditch I&#8217;ve fallen into many times. I&#8217;d simply look at myself in the mirror, confess some Scriptures over my life, and do my best to move on. The approach says, <em>Does God feel far away? Well, he\u2019s not, so fake it till you make it and keep going. Truth is true no matter how you feel about it, so believe and be on your way<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This approach has the appearance of wisdom. When your feelings accuse God, confessing Scripture is a great way to begin a journey out of the bog of depression. But there\u2019s a problem: confessing truth without understanding the lies often leads to misapplying that truth.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if I feel like God is far away, and I confess Scripture\u2019s promise that he&#8217;ll never leave me, I&#8217;ve said something true. But if I don\u2019t first take time to understand what my feelings are telling me, I may be confronting a lie I\u2019m not actually struggling with. After some reflection, I might realize this feeling of God\u2019s absence is making me deeply fearful. Since I tend to rush past times of reflection and move immediately to confrontation, I miss the opportunity to confess the scriptural truth that would help me grow.<\/p>\n<p>When we rush past our emotions, we end up stoic\u2014hard-hearted, acting as if our emotions don\u2019t matter when our emotionality is a good gift from God.<\/p>\n<h3>Feelings Alone Make You Unstable<\/h3>\n<p>After a while, the stoic approach would break down and, losing all control, my emotions would take over. I&#8217;d allow myself to feel all my pain, sorrow, sadness, and fear and all the accusations those emotions make against God and others. I&#8217;d rage and cry and experience outbursts that ended up hurting me and those relationships I hold most dear. Perhaps you&#8217;re thinking, <em>Well, Adam, you sound pretty unstable<\/em>. That&#8217;s exactly the point. Instability is the outcome of hyperemotionality.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a kind of sufferer who allows his emotions not just to be present but to be in charge. Wallowing in the muck of self-pity, he feels as if he has every right to do so. And he weaponizes the empathy of others, demanding they join him in the mud if he&#8217;s to truly feel &#8220;seen.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Most Westerners are shaped by stories, songs, and sitcoms that exalt the expression of emotions as the truest way to be human. Yet this is the way of the world, not the church. When God seems gone and we rage, we end up in a worse spot than when we started.<\/p>\n<h3>Feelings and Faith in the Presence of a Faithful God<\/h3>\n<p>Time and trial have taught me these aren&#8217;t the way of wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>The Bible gives us stories of great men who experienced an acute case of God\u2019s absence. Habakkuk&#8217;s book begins after a long period of God\u2019s silence, and he prays, \u201cHow long shall I cry for help?\u201d (Hab. 1:2). David laments, \u201cWhy have you forsaken me?\u201d (Ps. 22:1). These men were talking to God even while their emotional experiences of God were of absence and abandonment.<\/p>\n<p>When God seems gone and my emotions are ablaze, he&#8217;s still at work and wants me to come to him.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When God seems gone and my emotions are ablaze, he\u2019s still at work and wants me to come to him.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Realizing God\u2019s work through our emotions was revolutionary to me. He wants me to be aware of my emotions, acknowledge them, and bring them to him\u2014even when it feels like he&#8217;s not good, not listening, or not even there. And it\u2019s what he wants you to do as well.<\/p>\n<p>The false gospel of our culture\u2019s obsession with identity demands we only express what feels most true to ourselves. We&#8217;re told such expression is the only way to be truthful and authentic. But that&#8217;s a lie. The people of God are invited to bring our worst experiences of God\u2019s absence into the reality of God\u2019s presence.<\/p>\n<p>It may not feel like it\u2019s working, and that&#8217;s OK. Feelings are only good at telling you how you feel. But once you see them and bring them to God, the facts of his Word will begin to move the needle in your soul. When he next feels close, you&#8217;ll know him better than you did before. Such a gift only comes when God seems gone.<\/p>\n",

In fact, the list below may be overwhelming for many. But the goal of this list is to provide a brief introduction to noteworthy books on missions for those who want to learn more. Within each category you&#8217;ll find a recommendation to \u201cStart here.\u201d Subsequent works are arranged alphabetically by author, and their ordering doesn&#8217;t suggest priority.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any book I recommend, presence on this list doesn\u2019t suggest my complete agreement with the authors on every issue\u2014or even on significant points in their works. Some of the authors below actively disagree with one another. Nevertheless, these books have much to commend them to the discerning reader.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this selection, you\u2019ll find books large and small, some academic and some more accessible. Many of the authors below are prolific missiologists with excellent books on a variety of subjects, not to mention numerous articles. But I\u2019ve limited myself to one entry per writer. I&#8217;ve also limited this list to broad and general categories.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGospel movements move at the speed of trust.\u201d That\u2019s what my colleague shared as we sat around a table with a group of Tanzanian pastors in their city of Dar es Salaam. What drew us here wasn\u2019t the warm weather or the ocean views but the possibility of partnership. As we enjoyed a meal together, my love for this city of 6 million was growing. New bonds of trust were beginning to form.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global partnerships have always been at the core of the church\u2019s mission strategy. But we\u2019ve entered a new era of collaborative opportunities. World Christianity scholar F. Lionel Young III says we\u2019re living in the century of partnership. Changes in technology, transportation, and globalization have flung open the door to cooperation among Christians around the globe. This is an exciting time in world missions, but it\u2019s a moment that requires us to rethink our partnership paradigms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift in global Christianity has been well documented. What hasn\u2019t been as well discussed are the how-tos of global partnerships. At first, collaboration sounds great. But where do we start? How do we take our desire for partnerships from a good idea to real practices and strategies? I believe trust isn\u2019t just the fuel that propels gospel movements\u2014it\u2019s the spark that starts the engine. Here are three questions to help you begin to develop global partnerships for the gospel.<\/p>\n<h3>Whom Do You Trust?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, missionaries would return and tell stories of locals being trained and equipped. We still need to be sending traditional missionaries to do that work. But our mission paradigm should include partnering directly with indigenous leaders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I often receive this question: \u201cIf I don\u2019t have existing global relationships, where do I start?\u201d This is my answer: You\u2019re closer to your next global partner than you think. You\u2019re only one introduction away. The barriers that once kept us only hearing or reading about the amazing work of indigenous leaders are dissipating. Through technology, travel, and globalization, we\u2019re now in an era that allows us to build direct relationships with local leaders.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Our mission paradigm should include partnering directly with indigenous leaders.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global partnerships never start with a telemarketer-like cold call. Collaboration grows out of relationships. When you go looking for a church or leader to work with, start by asking the people you already know and trust for introductions. Whom do your existing missionaries recommend? Can a pastor you know connect you with someone he trusts? When looking to start a new partnership, work from the relationships you already have that can get you started in the right direction.<\/p>\n<h3>How Do You Earn Trust?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money has a way of making a mess of missions. For far too long, money has skewed Western perspectives on partnership. North American churches have too often approached partnerships by asking whether indigenous leaders can be trusted with American funding. This mindset must go. While we should seek to be good stewards of our resources, the radical generosity of our Savior should mark our posture in partnership.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once we&#8217;ve been introduced to a potential partner, our first foot forward must be one of generosity, not suspicion. A mindset of suspicion approaches a relationship only asking whether the other party is trustworthy. But a mindset of generosity approaches a relationship seeking to be a trustworthy person.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do we do this? We start by showing genuine interest in them, not just in what we expect them to do. We also shouldn\u2019t expect the potential partner to put more work into the relationship than we do.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust takes time to build, but we can start in small ways. If they\u2019re doing a youth camp, we can offer to help provide scholarships to their students. If they have a training program for leaders in their church, we can ask if there\u2019s a book they\u2019d like and provide copies for them. If possible, you can invite the pastor to come visit your church and even preach. These are small ways to develop the relationship, and they can go a long way toward building long-term partnerships.<\/p>\n<h3>What Are You Trusting God For?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I sat around the table with the Tanzanian pastors, one of the questions we began to ask is what they were asking God to do in their city. The best way to build a partnership is by building a shared vision. The apostle Paul developed such a vision among churches stretched across the Mediterranean by making the gospel primary, showing deep affection for others, and communicating ministry needs.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A mindset of generosity approaches a relationship seeking to be a trustworthy person.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A shared vision helps you align resources and take tangible action. It enables those in the partnership to pray with specificity and passion for the mission. A shared vision also helps to reinforce the value of collaboration among the partners. This is especially important in times of crisis, and it helps the partnership weather the challenges that inevitably arise in the course of a long-term, cross-cultural relationship.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work of the gospel in a city or region is too much for any one church. As the famous Japanese author Ryunosuke Satoro is quoted as saying, \u201cIndividually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.\u201d So it is with believers around the world.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s through gospel partnerships across cultural and geographic borders that I believe we&#8217;ll one day see Habakkuk\u2019s vision come to pass. May God use our collective efforts for the sake of Christ so the whole earth will be &#8220;filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea&#8221; (Hab. 2:14).<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>\u201cIf Jesus was really going to come back, wouldn\u2019t he have returned by now?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a pastor, I&#8217;ve fielded this question more than once. And to be honest, I\u2019ve asked this question myself. My guess is you have too.<\/p>\n<p>Doubts about Jesus\u2019s second coming can be the result of any number of factors. When seemingly senseless tragedy strikes\u2014whether on a global scale, such as a devastating earthquake, or on a more personal level, like a terminal diagnosis or a miscarriage\u2014it can be easy to wonder if God has given over the world to its fallen condition.<\/p>\n<p>A Christian\u2019s trust in, and subsequent disappointment by, any one of the numerous failed predictions of when Jesus would return (e.g., <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Miller_(preacher)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">William Miller<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Edgar_C._Whisenant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Edgar Whisenant<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Harold_Camping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harold Camping<\/a>) can shake one\u2019s faith in the trustworthiness of Jesus, the Bible, or Christian leaders.<\/p>\n<p>If left unchecked, seeds of doubt about the second coming can come to the full fruition of disbelief. Those who doubt are at risk of succumbing to the conclusion that there\u2019s no real, hope-filled future for this world; that this life is all we have; and that God\u2014if he exists\u2014has no interest in our world.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, questions about the second coming aren\u2019t new. In fact, doubts arose soon after Jesus\u2019s resurrection and ascension. We can find answers to our doubts in the pages of the New Testament.<\/p>\n<h3>Answering Doubts with Truth<\/h3>\n<p>One such place is in 2 Peter 3. There, Peter warns that \u201cscoffers\u201d would come and laugh at those who still wait for Jesus to return: \u201cThey will say, \u2018Where is the promise of his coming?\u2019\u201d (3:4). How should we think about Christ\u2019s second coming amid the scoffing of a skeptical world and our own doubt-laden minds?<\/p>\n<p>Peter offers three theological answers for us to consider.<\/p>\n<h4>1. God is active (2 Pet. 3:5\u20137).<\/h4>\n<p>It may seem like God isn\u2019t active in our world, that he\u2019s distanced himself from the mess we\u2019ve made. But Peter says no. God is very involved in our world. By pointing to creation, Peter reminds us God was active in the past. He points to the flood of Noah\u2019s day\u2014God has intervened in the world, and he\u2019s active now as well. Peter says the world is \u201cstored up\u201d and \u201ckept\u201d by God even now for the day of judgment (cf. Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3).<\/p>\n<p>This means we can never say God isn\u2019t active in this world or in our lives. The sun rose this morning as it does each day. You woke with a beating heart and with breath in your lungs. All that and more are gifts from our Creator and Sustainer.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We can never say God isn\u2019t active in this world or in our lives.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If God was active in the past to create and judge, he&#8217;ll be active today\u2014and in the future. Just as he created, he&#8217;s sustaining. Just as he brought judgment and salvation in the past, he&#8217;ll bring judgment and salvation in the future.<\/p>\n<h4>2. God is eternal (2 Pet. 3:8\u20139a).<\/h4>\n<p>Peter next appeals to God\u2019s eternal nature. God is the uncreated One, with no beginning and no end. His relationship with time is different than ours. As Matthew Barrett <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/None-Greater-Undomesticated-Attributes-God\/dp\/0801098742\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">states<\/a>, God \u201ctranscends time, is eternal to time, and is timelessly eternal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t true of us, of course. We <i>are<\/i> bound by time. Dr. Strange and Marty McFly may time travel in movies, but in the real world, we live moment by moment, unable to go back or jump ahead. We&#8217;re finite, but God is infinite. So who are we to judge God\u2019s timing? Like Paul\u2019s answer to the objection to election in Romans 9:19\u201321, Peter reminds us we, as finite creatures, are in no position to accurately judge the infinite Creator.<\/p>\n<h4>3. God is patient (2 Pet. 3:9).<\/h4>\n<p>Why hasn\u2019t Jesus returned yet? Because God is patient. His loving patience leads him to wait so all his people might reach repentance.<\/p>\n<p>Today the gospel is preached throughout the world. More and more people are hearing the good news of God\u2019s work through Christ, and more and more people are responding with repentant faith. For that to continue, God\u2019s judgment is delayed (cf. Acts 17:30).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re finite, but God is infinite. So who are we to judge God\u2019s timing?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Have you wondered why God didn\u2019t wipe out all creation immediately after Adam and Eve sinned? Because God is patient. Why hasn\u2019t God brought judgment though incredible evil persists in the world? Because he\u2019s patient. Why wouldn\u2019t God immediately destroy you and me though we were his enemies before we came to faith in Christ? Because God is patient. God has delayed necessary, proper, judgment so his people may be reconciled to him as they respond to the gospel.<\/p>\n<h3>Called to Patient, Holy Living<\/h3>\n<p>How, then, should we respond to others\u2019 objections and our doubts about Jesus\u2019s second coming? Remember that God is active, so he hasn\u2019t walked away. God is eternal, so he doesn\u2019t answer to us or to our ticking clocks. And God is patient, so we should be too.<\/p>\n<p>You and I are called to patience, holy living, and trusting in God\u2019s steadfast promise to eventually bring the fullness of our salvation and make all things new (2 Pet. 3:10\u201313).<\/p>\n<p>Hang in there, saints. Jesus <i>is<\/i> coming again.<\/p>\n",

One with dementia and one with kidney failure, one a believer and one not\u2014both of whom I was called to care for until their deaths. I was completely dedicated to their care, and even with the Lord as my source of strength, it was extremely difficult every day and on every level. But if I could do it all over again, I would.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you\u2019re called to a season of caring for a Christian parent with whom you&#8217;ve always had a great relationship, so there&#8217;s deep, reciprocal love and devotion. Although caregiving is still challenging, it likely comes with joy. But perhaps you have a painful and strained relationship with one or both of your parents that makes caregiving more complicated. Perhaps, like me, you have a parent who doesn\u2019t know the Lord, and caregiving is harder because his life is marked by sin and unbelief.<\/p>\n<p>When we <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/aging-parent-rejects-help\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">offer ourselves as caregivers<\/a>, image-bearers receive care and dignity, our good works testify to our faith, and our care could become a means of grace for the Lord to save unbelieving parents. But caregiving isn&#8217;t just a blessing to our parents\u2014the Lord uses it for our good too.<\/p>\n<h3>Why We Care for Our Parents<\/h3>\n<p>Throughout my childhood, my father made some decisions that brought harm to our family. My siblings and I were deeply hurt by him. Maybe you can relate. But as real as our feelings are, remember that how we feel about our parents isn&#8217;t what determines whether we honor them. Rather, we care for our parents out of obedience to the Lord\u2019s command: &#8220;Honor your father and your mother\u201d (Ex. 20:12).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>How we feel about our parents is not what dictates whether we honor them.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes there&#8217;ll be circumstances that make it impossible or even unsafe to provide care for a parent. But God\u2019s command doesn&#8217;t make exceptions for parents who didn\u2019t raise us in the Lord, or with whom we didn\u2019t have a close relationship, or who weren\u2019t good parents. Christians who are able are responsible for the care of our parents.<\/p>\n<p>Because my father didn\u2019t know the Lord, his thoughts and behaviors were consistent with the nature of an unbeliever. But I <em>do<\/em> know the Lord, and I have a new heart along with the mind of Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Caring for my dad was consistent with my new nature, even if his nature didn\u2019t change.<\/p>\n<h3>How Caregiving Blesses Us<\/h3>\n<p>One of my constant prayers while taking care of my dad was that the Lord would use me to save him, so I shared the gospel often, answered his questions, and tried not to compromise my witness. Sadly, my dad didn\u2019t come to faith, but that doesn\u2019t mean my time and effort spent caring for him were wasted.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of how an unbelieving parent responds to us or to the gospel, the Lord uses our care in his or her life\u2014and in ours. Consider these three blessings of caregiving.<\/p>\n<h4>1. We Glorify Our Heavenly Father<\/h4>\n<p>We were created to glorify God. Our lives can glorify God in many ways, including by taking care of the ones that God appointed to care for us. When we honor our earthly parents, we honor our heavenly Father. Caregiving is so hard and so all-encompassing that God\u2019s glory has to be the motivation. Those in close proximity will see our good works and give glory to our Father who is in heaven (Matt. 5:16).<\/p>\n<h4>2. We Learn About Godly Love<\/h4>\n<p>Caregiving taxes us physically and stretches us spiritually. It calls us to make sacrifices to love and care for an image-bearer with a love that cannot always be returned in the same way. This love requires patience, calls for kindness, has no room for envy or pride, and is not self-seeking. It can\u2019t afford to be easily angered and makes a conscious decision not to keep a record of wrongs. This love has its trust in the Lord and fixes its hope on hearing \u201cwell done\u201d from him. This love perseveres. This is the kind of love we\u2019ve received from the Father, and as we give it to our parents, we understand God&#8217;s love more deeply.<\/p>\n<h4>3. We Grow in Maturity<\/h4>\n<p>Caregiving is a serious trial, and before it produces anything in us, it reveals something about us\u2014it will test our faith. We&#8217;ll quickly learn what our true spiritual condition is, and that\u2019s a good thing. Wherever we are in our faith, caregiving is like adding more weight to the spiritual bar. And as we endure by God\u2019s grace, our spiritual muscle will get stronger and more defined so we reach a new level of maturity. James says that when we let perseverance have its perfect work, we&#8217;ll be complete and lacking nothing\u2014strong in faith, able to endure hardships with joy, and mature (James 1:2\u20134).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Regardless of how our unbelieving parent responds to us or to the gospel, the Lord uses our care.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I spent seven years caring for my parents, and every single day I needed the Holy Spirit\u2019s help. Isn\u2019t that the ideal position for a Christian\u2014being needy? I learned what the apostle Paul came to learn as the Lord declared to him, \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness\u201d (2 Cor. 12:9). Paul responded, \u201cTherefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ&#8217;s power may rest on me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As we give ourselves joyfully to caring for our parents\u2014the one who knows the Lord and the one who doesn\u2019t\u2014our souls will reap the benefit and God will get the glory.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>For the entirety of my life until last year, my father served as a pastor in small churches in the Northeast. I watched him lead through the worship wars of the 1990s, through 9\/11, and through the COVID-19 pandemic. After 41 years in the pastorate, he retired.<\/p>\n<p>Over the summer, my mom, my brothers, and our families gathered to celebrate. It was an intimate gathering at the family camp we attended each summer since I was a boy. We also compiled a video of people from the three churches he served. Each story was unique, but I was struck by a common message. People talked about a pastor who was also a friend\u2014someone who made them laugh, provided godly help, and walked with them through their dark and difficult days.<\/p>\n<p>As I watched my dad tearfully receive those words of thanksgiving, I considered his view of success. In him, I\u2019ve seen a way of doing ministry that strengthens the soul and builds endurance for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/fuel-pastor-finish-line\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">finishing the race<\/a>. It involves a healthy view of rest, humble love, and a faithful walk with God.<\/p>\n<h3>Healthy Rest<\/h3>\n<p>Hebrews 4 describes the rest we enter because of Christ\u2019s finished work on the cross. Verse 10 says, \u201cWhoever has entered God&#8217;s rest has also\u202frested from his works as God did from his.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rest is tricky, but throughout my dad\u2019s career, he made sure to take days off. He used his vacation time and took sabbaticals when they were available. This required trusting God with his work enough to confidently walk away from it for a day, a week, or even three months. It took humility to know he wasn\u2019t so important that the ministry wouldn\u2019t continue without him.<\/p>\n<p>A benefit of this view of rest was my dad\u2019s presence in our family life. We spent days off together. Family vacations were a yearly tradition, and Dad was at all my major life events; I never remember feeling like his work at the church was more important than our family.<\/p>\n<p>Insufficient trust and humility can lead to overworked, tired, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/how-prevent-burnout\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">burned-out pastors<\/a>. Jesus tells us the Sabbath was made for man (Mark 2:27). We\u2019d be wise to listen and enjoy the gift. Sabbath may not make sense in today\u2019s economy, but stepping away from our work will only make it better.<\/p>\n<h3>Humble Love<\/h3>\n<p>My dad loves people. He\u2019s a faithful shepherd who would disciple anyone willing to follow him as he followed Christ (1 Cor. 11:1). Whenever I asked my dad how work was, he\u2019d have a story about someone growing in his faith or coming to know Jesus. The people he met at church, around town, at the hospital, or in homeless shelters meant more to him than attendance, programs, or money.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The people my dad met at church, around town, at the hospital, or in homeless shelters meant more to him than attendance, programs, or money.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t just his love for people that stood out\u2014it was his humility toward them. He considered others\u2019 needs more than his own. He patiently led people and congregations through the long, slow work of discipleship. He never viewed them as a means to an end.<\/p>\n<p>How often have we known or been the type of leader who sought personal gain? Are we obsessed with networking, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/gain-audience-lose-soul\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increasing our influence<\/a>, or finding fulfillment in church growth? When we are, our lack of humility can tempt us to lose patience with those we lead. But when we humble ourselves before God and others, we find the freedom to love and lead without expecting something in return.<\/p>\n<h3>Faithful Walk<\/h3>\n<p>I have vivid childhood memories of waking up to find my dad sitting in silence and solitude with his Bible and a cup of coffee. He was consistent in his walk with God, and he led others from an overflow of the Spirit\u2019s work in his life. His devotion has become even clearer to me in the last year. In retirement, nothing has changed. I see it, and his grandkids see it. When we\u2019re in the same house, he\u2019s still the first person awake with his Bible and coffee. Dad may have retired from ministry, but his walk with God continues.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I\u2019ve learned the hard way that my walk with God matters more than my work for him, and I can\u2019t do the latter without the former.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I often do my work <i>for<\/i> God, not <i>with<\/i> him. My study, prayer, and spiritual practices are more connected to my ministry than I\u2019d like to admit. I\u2019ve learned the hard way that my walk with God matters more than my work for him, and I can\u2019t do the latter without the former. We work with God by abiding in the Vine, dependent on the Spirit to grow his fruit in us (John 15:4; Gal. 5:22\u201323).<\/p>\n<p>How do we measure success? Results are often the barometer of success in churches because they\u2019re easier to measure. But God measures by faithfulness rather than results (Matt. 25:23). As I saw in my dad, he asks us to finish the race, not win it.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>\u201cWhat are you planning to do tomorrow for the one who brought you into the world?\u201d That\u2019s what a woman I&#8217;d just met asked me the day before Mother\u2019s Day a few years ago. I wished I had an answer, but I didn\u2019t. I briefly told her my Mother\u2019s Day plans and left with a sense of sadness and confusion.<\/p>\n<p>The answer to her question was far more complicated than she realized. How was she supposed to know I\u2019m adopted, especially since I look so much like my adoptive mother? How could she know the following day would bring streams of tears as I reflected on my birth mother\u2019s neglect alongside my adoptive mother\u2019s love?<\/p>\n<p>As occasions that celebrate the gift of family, Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day don&#8217;t only bring up emotions in parents. For children who have been adopted, these days may evoke grief, loss, and confusion as we\u2019re reminded of the absence of our biological parents. But Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day also remind adopted children of the presence of our adoptive parents. The combined feelings of loss and gain, joy and sorrow remind adopted children that, although we\u2019re not with the ones who bore us, we&#8217;re with the ones who chose us.<\/p>\n<p>As adopted children, how can we wisely navigate these familial holidays? And how can the church be more sensitive to the mingling of joy and pain that surrounds the adopted on these days?<\/p>\n<h3>Grieve Your Loss<\/h3>\n<p>Although adoption is full of beauty, it\u2019s only a reality because the world is broken. A child who&#8217;s adopted has endured the traumatic experience of losing his or her biological parents. Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day remind us of that loss. These holidays are times to celebrate, but it\u2019s also appropriate to take time to grieve. Lamenting on Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day doesn&#8217;t have to ruin the celebratory day for our parents. Lament and joy can flow together.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Although adoption is full of beauty, it\u2019s only a reality because the world is broken.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Godly sorrow is a necessary step on the road to healing. However, this godly sorrow isn&#8217;t the same as worldly despair. Godly sorrow is grieving with confidence, knowing our grief doesn&#8217;t go unseen by the Father. As the psalmist explains, \u201cBut you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted; you consider their grief and take it in hand. The victims commit themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless\u201d (Ps. 10:14, NIV). We grieve by bringing our losses before the Father, trusting our grief isn&#8217;t the end of the story.<\/p>\n<h3>Rejoice in Your Gain<\/h3>\n<p>While Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day are days to grieve the necessity of adoption, they\u2019re also times to rejoice in the gift of adoption. They&#8217;re occasions for adoptive children to joyfully reflect on the sacrificial love of our adoptive parents. It\u2019s a reminder that although we\u2019ve experienced tremendous loss, we&#8217;ve also received great gain.<\/p>\n<p>These are days to dwell on God\u2019s goodness and grace, to praise God for the help he provides those in need:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Sing to God, sing in praise of his name, extol him who rides on the clouds; rejoice before him\u2014his name is the LORD. A father to the fatherless, . . . God sets the lonely in families. (Ps. 68:4\u20136, NIV)<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s fitting for us to show gratitude to God as we reflect on the truth that although adoption is caused by brokenness, adoption isn&#8217;t defined by brokenness. Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day are days of rejoicing as we reflect on the loving presence of the family that chose us.<\/p>\n<h3>Hope in Your Future<\/h3>\n<p>Adoption reveals the fragility of family on earth while pointing to the stability of the family that is to come. Our earthly families are a reflection of the eternal family we&#8217;ll join when Christ returns.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing our future with Christ gives us hope in the moments when we\u2019re overwhelmed by the fragility of earthly families, for we know our security: \u201cThough my father and my mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me\u201d (Ps. 27:10, NIV). These holidays should point us to our heavenly Father who asks us, \u201cCan a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you!\u201d (Isa. 49:15, NIV).<\/p>\n<h3>How the Church Can Help<\/h3>\n<p>As we celebrate Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day in our churches, it\u2019s important to remember that not all families are able to participate with pure joy and thankfulness. So how can the church be more sensitive to the adopted on these days?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Adoption reveals the fragility of family on earth while pointing to the stability of the family that is to come.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Acknowledge the adopted among the groups who may be grieving on these days and pray for us. Consider ahead of time who you know in your church that\u2019s adopted and be ready to listen and offer comfort. The adopted shouldn&#8217;t have to walk through these days alone. With a little intentionality, the church can be ready to rejoice, grieve, and hope with adopted children on Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you planning to do tomorrow for the one who brought you into the world?\u201d If someone were to ask me this question again, I\u2019d have an answer: \u201cI plan to pray for her and grieve her absence. As for my adoptive mother, I\u2019m planning to celebrate her presence.\u201d<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Do you know anyone who would say he&#8217;s not busy? With the exception of older saints, who are more vital to the church than they often realize, I can\u2019t remember the last time I heard someone say life is slow and he has plenty of time. The busy life is the normal life. And it&#8217;s sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Let me tell you the story of a Christian friend of mine. Ben insisted he had no margin in his life. Yes, he knew he should take time to share the gospel with others. Because he&#8217;s a friend, I rather boldly asked him to look at his smartphone to see how much time he had spent on it in the recent past.<\/p>\n<p>He went to Screen Time and was shocked to see these weekly averages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social media: 5 hours 32 minutes<\/li>\n<li>Games: 2 hours 41 minutes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>The busy life is the normal life. And it\u2019s sad.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I asked if he looked at social media on his laptop, and he responded sheepishly, \u201cYes, probably 30 minutes a day.\u201d That\u2019s another 2 hours and 30 minutes per week. Do you see? Ben was spending 8 hours a week on social media and almost 3 hours a week on games.<\/p>\n<p>He turned red when I gently asked if he watches television or a streaming service. He nodded affirmatively and muttered, \u201cYeah, a couple hours a day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s Ben\u2019s annual time log for these areas of his life:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social media: 416 hours<\/li>\n<li>Games: 139 hours<\/li>\n<li>Television\/streaming: 730 hours<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s 1,285 hours of margin per year from just these three areas. How much unrealized margin do you have? Though I\u2019m not suggesting you do away with social media or entertainment, you can certainly carve out some time for more important aspects of your life\u2014including evangelism.<\/p>\n<h3>But I\u2019m Afraid!<\/h3>\n<p>I admit I haven\u2019t confirmed the number, but different sources I checked said \u201cDo not fear\u201d appears in the Bible 365 times. That\u2019s one admonition and encouragement for every day of the year.<\/p>\n<p>God knows we have to deal with fear. It&#8217;s a normal emotional reaction to many challenges in life. As an introvert, I fear going to social events where I&#8217;m expected to carry on small talk with people I hardly know. When I was a child, I remember fearing something would happen to my parents.<\/p>\n<p>Fear could very well be a reaction you have to sharing the gospel. The first time I told someone about Christ as a young adult, I thought my heart would beat right out of my chest. Then the unexpected words exited my mouth: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go to hell, do you?\u201d Oh, dear. God still used that moment of fear to bring my friend Jim to salvation in Christ. He calmly responded, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Can you tell me how to go to heaven?\u201d There you go.<\/p>\n<p>Pray that God will either remove the fear or use it as you seek to become a more obedient Great Commission Christian.<\/p>\n<h3>Multiplying Excuses<\/h3>\n<p>I wish I could say I have a good excuse when I\u2019m negligent about sharing my faith. The real issue is that I just don\u2019t do it.<\/p>\n<p>Excuses come naturally to us. We\u2019re too busy. We don\u2019t know what to say. We don\u2019t have any unbelievers in our lives. We don\u2019t know how to deal with objections. We don\u2019t want to offend people. We don\u2019t want people to see us as crazy or weird.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you\u2019ve used one or more of those. Or perhaps you&#8217;re more like I am. You really don\u2019t have an excuse. You simply fail to be obedient at times.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Perhaps you&#8217;re more like I am. You really don\u2019t have an excuse. You simply fail to be obedient at times.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I remember several years ago thinking my main challenge in being a Great Commission Christian was finding the time to witness. My excuse was that I was too busy. Then I started praying that God would give me opportunities to share Christ amid my busyness. Since that prayer, I&#8217;ve been blessed by one opportunity after another.<\/p>\n<p>Ask God to work amid your excuses. You&#8217;ll be amazed to see how he answers that prayer.<\/p>\n<h3>Use Your Margin<\/h3>\n<p>I hope you already have margin built into your life so you can deal with these immediate moments of need. Urgent matters don\u2019t have to stop evangelism. Indeed, it\u2019s possible that in a crisis you&#8217;ll find opportunities to be a Great Commission Christian.<\/p>\n<p>Pray for wisdom when urgent matters arise. Look for gospel opportunities in them.<\/p>\n",

Then the membership figures continued to rise, peaking at 16.3 million members in 2006.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-554452 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11082554\/sbc_membership_annotated22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1800\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11082554\/sbc_membership_annotated22.png 3000w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11082554\/sbc_membership_annotated22-300x180.png 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11082554\/sbc_membership_annotated22-768x461.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 2010, membership began to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.graphsaboutreligion.com\/p\/the-2022-data-on-the-southern-baptist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">noticeably decline<\/a>, with about 100,000 members lost per year. Then those losses began to accelerate. By 2019, the annual drop was more than a quarter million members. In the last three years, the shift has been staggering: 435,000 lost in 2020, 410,000 in 2021, and then 484,000 in 2022. In total, the SBC has lost more than 1.3 million people in just three years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no single cause for such a steep drop in membership, but the data suggests some contributing trends.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Decline in Institutional Trust<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there\u2019s one main feature of American life in 2023, it\u2019s that people don\u2019t trust institutions. Data from the General Social Survey indicates trust in banks, education, Congress, major companies, the media, and medicine is down precipitously from a few decades ago. That\u2019s true for baby boomers and millennials alike.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust in organized religion is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.graphsaboutreligion.com\/p\/trust-and-not-believe-or-believe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">down<\/a>, as well. Breaking the data down into five-year birth cohorts makes that clear. For those who were born in the 1940s and 1950s, trust in religion declined when they were in their 30s and 40s but has stayed relatively stable from that point forward. The same isn&#8217;t true for younger Americans.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-554453 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11083055\/relig_conf_gss21_cohort.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2700\" height=\"1800\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11083055\/relig_conf_gss21_cohort.png 2700w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11083055\/relig_conf_gss21_cohort-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11083055\/relig_conf_gss21_cohort-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2700px) 100vw, 2700px\" \/>For instance, among people born in the 1980s, over 40 percent expressed a great deal of confidence in organized religion when they were coming into adulthood. From that point forward, trust has taken a nosedive. Now less than 20 percent of these birth cohorts think they can trust organized religion. Younger generations express the same level of distrust.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the SBC has a congregational polity where local churches have autonomy, it\u2019s still seen as a large religious institution by outsiders. That perception is especially acute given the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/faqs-sexual-abuse-southern-baptist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sexual abuse scandals<\/a> that have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/southern-baptist-sexual-abuse-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rocked the SBC<\/a> and led to a Department of Justice investigation.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Demographics<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the realities facing many Protestant denominations\u2014including the SBC\u2014is that their membership is aging.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the one hand, this reflects the general demographics of America as the large baby boomer generation pulls the statistics toward the older end. But on the other hand, the percentage of adult SBC members aged over 65 (33 percent) is significantly larger than the percentage of adult Americans over 65 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.googleadservices.com\/pagead\/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=Cu8FD7elcZJDMK8qKtOUPyreZgAq8nJH2bfHQspqkEIGmu4XRMAgAEAEguVRgyZaLiPCj7BKgAfqY_eUCyAEByAPYIKoEd0_QcWrBqrk-lSpBlNdHcIwglwrS-8yvVU83Eiz0wQGN0lvnzQd-75UMxszs_KIAQlemwCgjID2t6fzhOnBcl-mRzLffETK3sCgkNZ3lXCt-PwSAEDcp0CoE96Qvu4GG1ZT2K8hthnQ5N5MvuvGw1XU4KjFVcA0KwASj1-fPgQSABZBOiAWP-e-vQKAGZoAH7uaCmgGIBwGQBwGoB6a-G6gHvK2xAqgHuauxAqgHuZqxAqgH89EbqAfu0huoB_-csQKoB8rcG6gHu6SxAqgH2KaxAqgH26qxAqgH0KqxAqgHibKxAqAIm9GmBLAIAdIIGBACIISDAjIEg-CCDjoCAAJCAQRI0ezzKpoJY2h0dHBzOi8vdXNhZmFjdHMub3JnL2RhdGEvdG9waWNzL3Blb3BsZS1zb2NpZXR5L3BvcHVsYXRpb24tYW5kLWRlbW9ncmFwaGljcy9vdXItY2hhbmdpbmctcG9wdWxhdGlvbrEJ1oUth7hETnm5Cb8OuilFg_tj-AkBmAsBogwIKgYKBMOwsQKqDAIIAbgMAdoMCAoDIIIBEgEC6AwGqg0CVVOCFBcIAhITdXMgcG9wdWxhdGlvbiBjaGFydMgU0YLW6MjMqbkh0BUBmBYB-BYBgBcBkhcJEgcIARADGNwB4BcC&amp;ae=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwimzteDrO3-AhXFOkQIHdv9BAcQ0Qx6BAgHEAE&amp;nis=2&amp;dct=1&amp;cid=CAASFORokdntpYCJwEzT1O7e3577PDYe&amp;dblrd=1&amp;sival=AF15MEBlWEY11_4MOQR21WIayrcAR5ogaP4nJOb4OzGXMI1bmyJi4lg0RjopFvTHYZ0qtlvKLMSL-__hef0_ZE25oR97P8C1M8w4a7GYuNUxcWFxMiqGARMeKQxnvG5Hp1dmq5AB12kBIvqSMLkhaZcPvr5xtt8vm4NPOZdMV5c1T5qfIIor2yXSxkzQC9b5FxXJz2nsbaQq&amp;sig=AOD64_1y45_tdaGebldjpAwxiRNPhbu4dQ&amp;adurl=https:\/\/usafacts.org\/data\/topics\/people-society\/population-and-demographics\/our-changing-population%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3DND-DemPop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">22 percent<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-554454 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11083647\/age_distribution22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11083647\/age_distribution22.png 1800w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11083647\/age_distribution22-270x300.png 270w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11083647\/age_distribution22-768x853.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a decade or two, it\u2019s likely half of the oldest age group will be unable to attend church services for one reason or another. Another 26 percent have seen their 55th birthday. In the average SBC church, three out of five adults are 55 or older, while just 25 percent are under the age of 45.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For churches to maintain their membership, they have to offset every death by one new member. Often, those new members come through raising up children in the faith. But that becomes harder when the demographics are tilted so much toward seniors.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Nones and the Nons<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way for a church to offset the losses of an older generation is through new converts. However, recent years have seen fewer converts in increasingly secular America. The rise of the nones indicates a large share of young people who declare themselves unwilling to entertain religious faith.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-554509 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11092612\/none_years_gen22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11092612\/none_years_gen22.png 2000w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11092612\/none_years_gen22-300x180.png 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11092612\/none_years_gen22-768x461.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/>Among Generation Z\u2014those born in 1996 or later\u2014the share who identify as atheist, agnostic, or nothing in particular <a href=\"https:\/\/religioninpublic.blog\/2023\/04\/03\/gen-z-and-religion-in-2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has risen<\/a> from 39 percent in 2016 to 48 percent in 2022. This means nearly half of the youngest adults have walked away from religion entirely.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They aren\u2019t the only ones to join the ranks of the nones, however. The percentage of millennials who have no religious affiliation has also risen, from 33 percent in 2008 to 44 percent in 2022. Even Gen X and baby boomers are more likely to be nonreligious now than a decade ago.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What may be an even bigger threat to the SBC is the dramatic rise in nondenominational churches. When looking at the size of every major Protestant tradition over the last 14 years, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/tim-keller-decline-renewal-american-church\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">common thread is decline<\/a>. Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, and Presbyterians are all a smaller share of the population now than they were in 2008. The only exception is nondenominational Christians. They were 7.1 percent of the total population in 2008, but that number has risen to 8.6 percent in 2022.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-554523 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11093350\/prot_size22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1650\" height=\"1800\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11093350\/prot_size22.png 1650w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11093350\/prot_size22-275x300.png 275w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/11093350\/prot_size22-768x838.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px\" \/>One advantage of nondenominational churches is that they don\u2019t have institutional baggage like many denominations, including the SBC. While people are skeptical of putting money in the offering plate and having some of it go to a head office hundreds of miles away, in nondenominational churches those leadership decisions are handled by people sitting in the pews each weekend. In a time of declining trust in institutions, nondenominationals are well-positioned, and are reaping the benefits through rising attendance and giving.<\/p>\n<p>But the disadvantage of nondenominational churches is that they don\u2019t carry the same influence as churches that are banded together. They don\u2019t have the same ability to do missions, influence culture, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/how-southern-baptists-trained-more-disaster-relief-volunteers-than-the-red-cross\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">care for humanitarian needs<\/a> as a denomination, nor are they accountable to any outside authority.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Southern Baptist Convention is facing the same headwinds plaguing nearly every other religious institution in the U.S. The decline in institutional trust, the aging of an unusually large generation, and the rise in atheism make it increasingly difficult for denominations to thrive.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s some good news for Southern Baptists. The attendance that declined sharply during COVID <a href=\"https:\/\/research.lifeway.com\/2023\/05\/09\/southern-baptists-decline-in-membership-grow-in-attendance-baptisms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bounced<\/a> up a bit, as did small group attendance. Baptisms also increased, though not yet to pre-COVID numbers. For the Southern Baptists to recover their losses, trends like these will have to continue and increase.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>\u201cI think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I often return to these words from C. S. Lewis in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Reflections-Psalms-C-S-Lewis\/dp\/0062565486\/\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Reflections on the Psalms<\/i><\/a>. They sum up why I love being an arts and culture critic. It\u2019s one thing to watch a stellar film or discover something arrestingly beautiful on Spotify. But to be able to praise these things publicly and celebrate their virtues <i>communally<\/i>\u2014that\u2019s when the enjoyment feels complete.<\/p>\n<p>Lewis goes on,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">It is frustrating to have discovered a new author and not to be able to tell anyone how good he is; to come suddenly, at the turn of the road, upon some mountain valley of unexpected grandeur and then to have to keep silent because the people with you care for it no more than for a tin can in the ditch; to hear a good joke and find no one to share it with. . . . The Scotch catechism says that man\u2019s chief end is &#8220;to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.&#8221; But we shall then know that these are the same thing. Fully to enjoy is to glorify. In commanding us to glorify Him, God is inviting us to enjoy Him.<\/p>\n<p>Lewis\u2019s insight here captures how I\u2019ve felt about Jon Guerra\u2019s new album, <a href=\"https:\/\/jonguerra.lnk.to\/ordinary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Ordinary Ways<\/i><\/a> (out today) since I first started listening to an advanced copy. It\u2019s been hard not being able to share it with others (until now!), because it\u2019s just that good\u2014even better than Guerra\u2019s rightly acclaimed previous album, <a href=\"https:\/\/hyperurl.co\/keeperofdays\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Keeper of Days<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But Lewis\u2019s quote also, in a way, sums up <i>why<\/i> Guerra\u2019s new album is so good. Because <i>Ordinary Ways <\/i>perfectly captures the infectious alchemy of where worship and enjoyment meet. This is seriously devout <i>and <\/i>joyful music. Part of the album\u2019s power is just how captivated it is by the God to whom every lyric is directed and every note offered. To listen to Guerra\u2019s collection of 13 psalm-like poetic prayers\u2014which are as lyrically profound and musically brilliant as anything I\u2019ve heard from any artist this year\u2014is to have one\u2019s own affections for God unavoidably stirred.<\/p>\n<p>Emotions are contagious, and our tendency to be affected by the affections of others is how we&#8217;re wired. This is why, like the Psalms themselves, the personal musical prayers of an exceptional artist like Guerra are so potent when they&#8217;re shared.<\/p>\n<h3>Contemporary Psalms<\/h3>\n<p>In describing the genre of his music, Guerra opts for \u201cdevotional music,\u201d which he says is \u201cless Sunday morning worship music and more Monday morning prayer music.\u201d In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/jon-guerra-monday-morning-prayer-music\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my 2020 interview with him for <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/jon-guerra-monday-morning-prayer-music\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Gospel Coalition<\/a>, Guerra (based in Austin, Texas) describes devotional music as \u201chighly personal\u201d in nature\u2014songs birthed out of no intention other than devotional intimacy with God:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">[Devotional music] has no practical boundary, just one large spiritual boundary: prayer. The music, language, style, and personal expression are, ideally, all alive with prayer. It takes cues from the Psalms.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the Psalms are all over this album\u2014explicitly and in its overall tone. Lead single \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pRL83-OVI8Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Let a Little Light In<\/a>,\u201d for example, shifts musically in its latter half to a rousing riff on Psalm 23:6. Final track \u201cOne Thing I Have Asked\u201d is an anthemic setting of Psalm 27:4. The poetic lament \u201cHow Long\u201d takes inspiration from Psalm 13. The confessional, repentance-celebrating \u201cIllness of the Heart\u201d wrestles with sin in the vein of Psalm 51.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>To listen to Guerra\u2019s collection of 13 psalm-like poetic prayers is to have one\u2019s own affections for God unavoidably stirred.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Taken as a whole, the psalm-like sonic prayers of <i>Ordinary Ways <\/i>are an extraordinary gift. Guerra and his musically gifted wife, Valerie, sometimes release songs under the name <a href=\"https:\/\/www.praytellmusic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Praytell<\/a> and also compose music together for Terrence Malick films. They\u2019re inspiring powerhouses of contemporary sacred art. And this album, I\u2019d submit, is their greatest offering yet.<\/p>\n<p>Wherever Jon and Valerie\u2019s songs started in private\u2014born out of personal pain or anxiety, late-night exhaustion or early-morning epiphany\u2014they\u2019re now facilitators of worship for souls far and wide. They\u2019ve already ministered to me as I\u2019ve listened to them in a roller-coaster season of stress and exhaustion, and I have no doubt they\u2019ll minister to listeners around the world in whatever they\u2019re going through.<\/p>\n<h3>God Is the Focal Point<\/h3>\n<p>Why will these songs inspire listeners to worship God? Because they aren\u2019t songs about Jon Guerra. Though written from a personal vantage point, this is an album squarely, unapologetically, and very counter-culturally about God.<\/p>\n<p>This is clear from the album opener, \u201cThe Lord Will Provide.\u201d With an eclectic mix of subdued acoustic lyricism and cacophonous horns and drum machines reminiscent of Radiohead, the song kicks off a theme of praising God <i>amid <\/i>our pain and suffering, in a way that puts the accent not on our predicament but on God\u2019s provision. The first lines of the album declare, in faith, \u201cIn some way or another, the Lord will provide \/ It may not be my way \/ It may not be your way. But he will.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>From there, the album begins a worshipful journey that unfolds like an extended conversation with God. The songs are ordered, often, such that a lyric or question posed in one song is answered in the next. Consider the pairing of tracks 5 and 6: \u201cMy Transfiguration\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/JQPy0rae3DQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Lord\u2019s Prayer<\/a>.\u201d In \u201cMy Transfiguration,\u201d Guerra paraphrases Luke 1:1 in asking God, &#8220;Teach me how to pray in the ordinary ways.&#8221; Naturally, the next track is Guerra\u2019s gorgeous, Nick Drake\u2013esque rendition of the prayer Jesus recites in response to his disciples\u2019 inquiry (Luke 11:2\u20134).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This is an album squarely, unapologetically, and very counter culturally, about God.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Tracks 9 and 10 (\u201cLike You, Lord\u201d and \u201cYou Are All I\u2019m Worth\u201d) feel like a diptych reflection on identity. One of the album highlights for me, \u201cLike You, Lord,\u201d mulls the paradox of being image-bearers of One who is immeasurably greater than us (\u201cWho is like you, Lord?\u201d is repeated throughout the song, echoing a familiar Psalms refrain). \u201cWill I ever be \/ Who I\u2019m meant to be?\u201d Guerra asks, ultimately landing in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/catechism-inspired-song\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consoling reminder of the Heidelberg Catechism<\/a>: &#8220;I am not my own.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is counter-cultural in a world where the expressive, autonomous self is so emphasized, yet Guerra doubles down on it in the next track, \u201cYou Are All I\u2019m Worth.\u201d Echoing Paul in 1 Corinthians 6:19\u201320, the song is exactly what its title would indicate. As if to emphasize what\u2019s clearly a key idea in the album at large, the chorus simply repeats this assertion nine times: \u201cYou are all I\u2019m worth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Radical in a world of expressive individualism, Guerra\u2019s humble poetry affirms the liberating truth of identity for the Christian: Finding ourselves is far less important than being found in Christ. If Christ is the truest human who ever lived, then Christ in us (Gal. 2:20) is the closest any of us will get to authentic humanity.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Guerra\u2019s humble poetry affirms the liberating truth of identity for the Christian: Finding ourselves is far less important than being found in Christ.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the album\u2019s stunning penultimate song, \u201cThank You, Lord,\u201d Guerra picks up the theme again, summing it up with the lyric \u201cWhat am I? \/ I am yours.\u201d It\u2019s as simple as that. The thing that matters most about us, in the end, is that we are not our own. We belong\u2014body and soul, in life and in death\u2014to Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p>As the song\u2019s gorgeous twinkling piano pirouettes against the acoustic guitar through-line, Guerra suggests our best response to life\u2019s ups and downs is gratitude to God. In what may be the year\u2019s most beautiful worship chorus, Guerra sings, \u201cThis is life \/ This is love \/ To be still and know you \/ All that\u2019s lost will be gained \/ Thank you, Lord.\u201d Guerra captures a similar sentiment in \u201cMy Transfiguration\u201d: \u201cThis is my transfiguration: To receive all things as grace \/ Whether toil or joy or pain.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>These aren\u2019t treacly sentiments; they\u2019re expressions of battle-weary wisdom. It\u2019s the insight of a soul not unfamiliar with faith struggles, yet one who ultimately affirms the truth of Proverbs 3:5\u20138. Health comes not from an orientation around our own understanding, but in full trust and submission to him.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Jon Guerra - The Lord&#039;s Prayer [Official Music Video]\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JQPy0rae3DQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3>Trust in the One from Nazareth<\/h3>\n<p>Throughout the album, Guerra manages a tone of joyful gratitude and full trust in God, even as he still has questions and references suffering.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Guerra\u2019s humble poetry affirms the liberating truth of identity for the Christian: finding ourselves is far less important than being found in Christ.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In \u201cNazareth\u201d\u2014perhaps the bounciest and most musically catchy song on the album\u2014Guerra oscillates between feeling God\u2019s distance and yet knowing his nearness. Guerra sings, \u201cI cannot face the mystery \/ I cannot change the history \/ But I name the love behind everything \/ When I praise the One from Nazareth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Praise illuminates. Shifting our gaze from ourselves and our mess, and toward the \u201clove behind everything,\u201d has a way of reframing life\u2019s chaos. There\u2019ll always be tensions and mysteries as we seek God\u2014parts about him we can grasp and parts we can\u2019t. Nevertheless, all things converge in him, and \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/blogs\/justin-taylor\/an-analysis-of-one-of-the-greatest-sentences-ever-written\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our hearts are restless till they find their rest in [him]<\/a>,\u201d to quote Augustine. Guerra meditates on this in \u201cBlueprint,\u201d a soaring, spacey M83-esque anthem that cultivates a heavenly ambiance and repeats the phrase \u201cYou are the all that all my soul is reaching for\u201d even as it rehearses the paradoxes that perplex us.<\/p>\n<p>We can love and trust God fully and unquestionably, even amid our questions. We can find peace and joy as we worship him, even amid our fears and laments. In today\u2019s \u201cthrow the baby out with the bathwater\u201d world of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/publication\/before-you-lose-your-faith-deconstruction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deconstruction<\/a> and faith abandonment, this is a sorely needed message.<\/p>\n<p>Yet as timely as it is, Guerra\u2019s <i>Ordinary Ways <\/i>is also absolutely timeless. It&#8217;s basic Christianity, basic trust, basic worship, humbly set to song. It\u2019s a slice of one bard\u2019s devotional life in 2020s Texas, yet it joins a chorus of awestruck praise that has been unceasing for centuries and will echo on in the heavenly throngs, world without end.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Have you seen the children\u2019s show <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/blueys-beautiful-conservatism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Bluey<\/em><\/a>? In one episode, Bluey and her little sister, Bingo, convince their dad, Bandit, to play along with their game and pretend he was born \u201cyesterday.\u201d Bandit, being a good sport, goes along with their antics.<\/p>\n<p>As they go about their day, Bandit is delightfully confused by everyday things like private property and the sun. The girls instruct him on how to deal with each thing he encounters, and he plays along, immersing himself in their world and seeing it through their eyes.<\/p>\n<p>What stands out in the episode is a moment when Bandit holds a leaf up to the sun and stares at it in wonder. The sunlight embosses the veins, turning the ordinary into something magical. After playtime is over, Bandit&#8217;s wife catches him still gazing at the leaf, completely entranced. \u201cI feel like a new dog!\u201d he exclaims as he finally comes back to reality.<\/p>\n<p>Bandit\u2019s innocent wonder as he holds that leaf is why I spend so much time talking about creation with kids. Why emphasize this tiny portion of Scripture? Why obsess over the intricacies of a passage every churchgoer already knows? If we want our kids to experience the world through new eyes, there\u2019s nothing more useful than a solid grounding in the story of creation. Here are three reasons why.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Teaching Genesis fosters biblical literacy.<\/h4>\n<p>Cover to cover, the Bible is filled with references to the book of Genesis. You can hardly find a page of Scripture that can be understood without some knowledge of the Bible\u2019s first book. Each of Genesis\u2019s first 11 chapters (except chap. 8) is referenced directly in the New Testament, and every New Testament author refers to this grouping of chapters at least once.<\/p>\n<p>Creation is one of the special covenant moments in the history of God\u2019s people that form their relationship with him. Genesis\u2019s early chapters have so formed the imagination of the biblical authors that they come back to them again and again.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Genesis\u2019s early chapters have so formed the imagination of the biblical authors that they come back to them again and again.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s well understood that all Scripture is a story about Jesus. It\u2019s equally true, but less often understood, that creation forms the context for this story. The truth is self-evident, which is why it\u2019s often missed. All Scripture (and all of life) takes place in the context of God\u2019s creation. This can be as simple as showing kids differing views on the details of the creation story. When we show them we can disagree on interpretation while affirming essential truths like &#8220;God is creator,&#8221; we reinforce for them that the Bible is trustworthy from cover to cover. If your kids know Genesis&#8217;s stories and are formed by them, they\u2019ll be better prepared to read fruitfully from the whole Bible. When they see how God\u2019s Word holds together, they\u2019ll be ready to fall in love with the One who holds the world together.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Teaching Genesis fosters biblical identity.<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s not just the Bible we want our kids to understand. We want them to see themselves, and all life, in its light.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis helps kids learn what it means to be human. We learn humans are the climax of God\u2019s creation work, and we learn that the creation of the woman is the pinnacle of the creation of humans. We learn humans are made from dirt and God\u2019s breath, an unlikely combination that results in the miracle of life. We see God giving us bodies as a gift. We see God creating with endless variety. We see his affection for all he has made, and we learn to trust in his affection for us as well.<\/p>\n<p>All these truths run counter to the world\u2019s assumptions, biases, and ideologies. If we don\u2019t intentionally provide our kids with a creation lens on life, they\u2019ll falter. But by placing the gospel within the Bible\u2019s creation framework, we see Christ\u2019s story with its all-encompassing and life-giving texture. Your kids need to see there\u2019s nothing abstract about the gospel, and a robust understanding of creation will help.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Teaching Genesis fosters a sense of wonder.<\/h4>\n<p>Consider Psalm 104:10\u201313:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">You make springs gush forth in the valleys;<br \/>\nthey flow between the hills;<br \/>\nthey give drink to every beast of the field;<br \/>\nthe wild donkeys quench their thirst.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell;<br \/>\nthey sing among the branches.<br \/>\nFrom your lofty abode you water the mountains;<br \/>\nthe earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.<\/p>\n<p>For the psalmist, these words flow freely, but we rarely hear such phrases in contemporary prayers. You could attend church for decades and never hear anyone pray or sing about thirsty donkeys and songbirds.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a loss. Our attention always limits our affection. We certainly can\u2019t give our kids affection while denying them attention. Likewise, our attention to the Maker\u2019s work is a limiting factor in our affection for him. Our kids will encounter countless wonders in their lives. The only question is whether we&#8217;ve trained them to ride the wave of wonder to a place of deep gratitude and affection for their Maker.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Our kids will encounter countless wonders in their lives. The only question is whether we&#8217;ve trained them to ride the wave of wonder to a place of deep gratitude and affection for their Maker.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s too much cynicism in the world. Often, there\u2019s more than enough cynicism in the church as well. At least part of the antidote is raising kids who are enthralled by God\u2019s creation, enraptured by the wonders of the Maker.<\/p>\n<p>When we teach our kids to look at the ordinary through the lens of God\u2019s goodness, they\u2019ll see it embossed by the light of his glory. When we do that intentionally, consistently, and tenaciously, we just might see them, like Bandit, holding a leaf up to the sun for hours. And when kids experience wonder like that, you\u2019ll know you\u2019re laying a foundation that can last a lifetime.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>A few years ago, I was preparing for a small group Bible study on Luke 14:26 according to my church\u2019s recommended steps. The Bible study steps culminated with \u201capplication\u201d (i.e., \u201cHow can you apply this to your life?\u201d), which is common in contemporary Bible studies. Yet I struggled to understand how to \u201capply to my life\u201d Jesus\u2019s call to \u201chate . . . [your] own life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As I wrestled with the text, I began to see the limitations of the practice of \u201capplication\u201d (at least, as it was presented to me). Throughout Scripture, the Lord calls us to more than minor tweaks and slight adjustments to our already stable lives. Instead, Jesus\u2019 call in Luke 14 (and in all of Scripture) is much deeper, wider, and even more practical than the language of \u201capplication\u201d captures.<\/p>\n<h3>3 Common, Faulty Assumptions<\/h3>\n<p>Again, my concern isn\u2019t about the importance of \u201cpracticing Christian doctrine\u201d (to borrow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Practicing-Christian-Doctrine-Introduction-Theologically\/dp\/0801049334\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beth Felker Jones\u2019s helpful phrase<\/a>). Indeed, the gospel of Jesus Christ changes every aspect of our lives through the power of the Holy Spirit, and Scripture helps us see the many outworkings of that.<\/p>\n<p>My main concern with the language of \u201capplication\u201d is that it can carry faulty\u2014and harmful\u2014assumptions about how we approach Scripture. Here are three.<\/p>\n<h4>Assumption #1: I should start with me and my questions.<\/h4>\n<p>The task of application implies using an external object to support a person and his or her purposes (e.g., applying sunscreen or a productivity technique). \u201cApplying Scripture\u201d can therefore assume a prioritization of me and my life as the starting point\u2014from which I can utilize the external object of a biblical truth. We often begin with our own perception of the world and <span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">then read the Bible to discover \u201cwhat it means to me,\u201d looking to address our lives, our questions, and our problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The danger is this assumption makes me the center of the interpretive solar system, with everything revolving around me and my life. The more a truth \u201capplies\u201d to my life, the more gravity it has. Anything that seems unapplicable to me gets dismissed and is relegated to the status of space debris.<\/p>\n<p><strong><i>Proposed alternative: Start with God.<\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rather than allowing our questions and assumptions to have the first say, so that we \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Eclipse-Biblical-Narrative-Eighteenth-Hermeneutics\/dp\/0300026021\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eclipse the biblical narrative<\/a>,\u201d we can begin with God\u2019s story and the reality of the world as he established it. We start reading Scripture with God as the fundamental reality, just as the Bible begins to tell the story: \u201cIn the beginning, God\u201d (Gen. 1:1).<\/p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t bring our questions or present our problems to God as we read Scripture (e.g. turning to particular Psalms in seasons of pain, fear, or grief; or reading Proverbs in family devotions to cultivate habits of wisdom). But it does mean we \u201cseek first the kingdom\u201d and consider our questions and problems <em>within that orientation<\/em>. We should avoid what <a style=\"font-size: 1em; outline-width: 0px; opacity: 0.8;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ethics-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Works-Vol\/dp\/0800683269\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\">Dietrich Bonhoeffer calls<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> the \u201cunbiblical\u201d search for a solution from the \u201cvantage point\u201d of humanity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s likely many of our questions will be addressed when we locate ourselves within God\u2019s story, the true story. Yet it\u2019s also possible the Lord\u2019s response to us\u2014like his responses to Job and Peter (Job 38\u201341; John 21:22)\u2014isn\u2019t a direct answer to our questions or an immediate solution to our problems but rather an even greater solution: his presence.<\/p>\n<h4>Assumption #2: The Bible is (primarily) a collection of principles.<\/h4>\n<p>Shallow approaches to application make <span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">assumptions about the object of our search. We turn the Bible into an answer key, a collection of principles, or \u201ceternal truths\u201d waiting to be \u201cdiscovered\u201d and \u201capplied.\u201d We read biblical stories, poetry, prophecy, epistles, and apocalyptic literature and ask, &#8220;What nugget can I take away from this?\u201d Sometimes it seems Scripture would be better suited to us if it were in the form of an Excel spreadsheet\u2014a series of lists of statements, rules, principles for life, and facts of the world ready to be applied to any given situation with a quick Control+F.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Like the rich young ruler who came to Jesus looking for some sage insight he might use in his already decent life (Mark 10:17\u201322), we come to the text of Scripture looking for a principle we might apply to our lives, our jobs, and our cars\u2019 bumpers. Yet in doing so, we too may miss out on the life-engulfing invitation of God in Scripture.<\/p>\n<p><strong><i>Proposed alternative: Scripture is (fundamentally) the story of God and his work.<\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My attempts to use Scripture primarily as a collection of principles can dull its living and active power (Heb. 4:12). Are there principles in Scripture? Certainly. But it\u2019s fundamentally an account of who God is and what he has done to redeem creation from the deleterious effects of sin.<\/p>\n<p>Scripture is, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Drama-Scripture-Finding-Place-Biblical\/dp\/0801049563\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has become popular to say<\/a>, a \u201cstory\u201d or \u201cdrama\u201d of God. Rather than picking out principles from the story (leaving the story behind once we\u2019ve derived the principle, like it\u2019s the kernel in a husk), the nature of this story inclines us (with all of ourselves) to be engrossed by it and to encounter its Author.<\/p>\n<h4>Assumption #3: The goal of reading the Bible is improving my life.<\/h4>\n<p>With this assumption, the application of Scripture ends up being more like a divine stamp of approval on pursuing my own goals for my own benefit. This reflex has led to an onslaught of (both good and bad) books and sermons on the \u201cbiblical way\u201d to do X (whether X is to make money, vote, dress, raise kids, do business, or even diet). Having been trained in these \u201capplication habits,\u201d I open my Bible and look for immediate personal benefits from the words of Scripture\u2014such as three takeaways or one minor behavioral change I can make on the spot.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unsurprising we find it difficult to appreciate the aspects of Scripture that seem to defy immediate application\u2014the Old Testament\u2019s peculiar stories, Israel\u2019s ceremonial customs, and the early church\u2019s apocalyptic expectations. These need not be shunned by the church because of their seemingly limited applicability but rather embraced as parts of God\u2019s story and God\u2019s work to redeem creation.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine asking a friend how her day was and two minutes into her summary interjecting, \u201cWait, tell me how this applies to me?\u201d We&#8217;d never do this. And yet we do it to God. We exchange the feast of relational intimacy and holistic formation for the porridge of minor behavioral change and practical nuggets for our optimized life.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We exchange the feast of relational intimacy and holistic formation for the porridge of minor behavioral change and practical nuggets for our optimized life.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong><i>Proposed alternative: The goal of reading the Bible is communing with God.<\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When we start from our problems and perspectives, looking for principles to improve our lives, we often miss God\u2019s invitation in Scripture to know and commune with him. God reveals himself in Scripture not primarily to make some aspect of our lives better on our terms but to bring us to himself\u2014to reveal his love for us and his desire to be with us.<\/p>\n<p>This is where we find true \u201cimprovement\u201d\u2014the abundant life in Jesus (John 10:10). Yet we don&#8217;t come to the abundant life by gradual life hacks toward our own goals on our own terms. We die to ourselves and find our lives in Christ (Gal. 2:20), orienting all aspects of ourselves toward God himself and communion with him.<\/p>\n<h3>Reorienting Our Reading<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve grown to love Scripture (and the God of Scripture) more as I upend the three faulty assumptions listed above. As we reorient our Bible reading, we begin to see the activity more like reading a good autobiography\u2014where we get to know and love the author\u2014than an instruction manual. Reading Scripture shouldn&#8217;t lead to changing one aspect of our character or giving up some small amount of time; it should remind us that Jesus is calling us to give up everything (Phil 3:8-10), even our own lives (Luke 14:26), so that he might change all of us (1 Thess. 5:23).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">As <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Letters-Diminished-Church-Passionate-Arguments\/dp\/0849945267\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dorothy Sayers says<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">, \u201cSurely it is not the business of the Church to adapt Christ to men, but to adapt men to Christ.\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">So, if we must choose between \u201capplying the Bible to our lives\u201d and \u201capplying our lives to the story of God,\u201d Sayers asks us to consider the latter\u2014to orient ourselves toward God, his true story of the whole world, and communion with him.<\/span><\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p><strong>The Story: <\/strong>A new survey reveals that while many Americans are curious about the Bible, relatively few regularly engage with God\u2019s Word. Could introducing them to biblical theology reverse that trend?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Background:<\/strong> The State of the Bible, a survey by the <a href=\"https:\/\/1s712.americanbible.org\/state-of-the-bible\/stateofthebible\/State_of_the_bible-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Bible Society and Barna Group<\/a> found that for most of the last decade, about half of Americans said they used the Bible three or more times per year. This low bar of engagement qualified them, by the survey\u2019s definition, as \u201cBible Users.\u201d In the previous poll (covering the year 2021), that number dropped 10 points, with only two in five Americans (39 percent) being Bible Users. In 2023, the responses matched that low point of 39 percent. Only about 63 million American adults (24 percent) use the Bible\u2014on their own, outside of a church service\u2014at least once a week.<\/p>\n<p>According to the survey, women (41 percent) are more likely to be Bible Users than men (36 percent). Never-married people (30 percent) are least likely to use the Bible, yet people who are separated (52 percent) are most likely. Black Americans (57 percent) are most likely to be Bible Users, while Asians (27 percent) and whites (35 percent) are least likely.<\/p>\n<p>Bible Use seems to increase with age, as elders (aged 77 or over, 48 percent) are most likely and Generation Z (30 percent) least likely to turn to Scripture. With regard to religious identity, evangelical (70 percent) and historically black (68 percent) Protestant denominations lead the way in Bible use, while Catholics (37 percent) remain low.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the low level of engagement with Scripture, nearly three in four Americans (71 percent) are curious about the Bible or Jesus, with more than one in four being \u201cvery\u201d (17 percent) or \u201cextremely\u201d (22 percent) curious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What It Means: <\/strong>If most Americans are curious about Jesus or the Bible, why do so few engage with Scripture? One possible reason is that they may not know how to approach the Bible because they&#8217;ve never been exposed to the study of biblical theology.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Nearly three in four Americans (71 percent) are curious about the Bible or Jesus.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Biblical theology <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/40-Questions-About-Biblical-Theology\/dp\/0825445604\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has been defined<\/a> as the study of how the whole Bible progresses, integrates, and climaxes in Christ. Jesse Johnson <a href=\"https:\/\/thecripplegate.com\/nancy-guthrie-10-ways-biblical-theology-helps-christians\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">explains<\/a>: \u201cBiblical Theology approaches the Bible as a cohesive narrative, with a crisis, conflict, climax, and resolution; it then interprets stories not in isolation, but rather as they relate to the whole. It intentionally approaches the Bible as one complete book, rather than as an anthology of short stories.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the \u201canthology\u201d approach is the way most Americans approach the Bible. They assume the important parts are found only in the New Testament, especially the Gospels since they tell us about Jesus directly. Modern Bible readers have a difficult time understanding the significance of the Old Testament, though they may acknowledge it has some value as moral literature.<\/p>\n<p>To effectively reach this group of unengaged Americans, Christians need to develop a more cohesive understanding of biblical theology. This will allow us to show how the entire Bible is about Jesus and why that matters for people&#8217;s lives. Two primary ways we can do this are by learning how to explain the larger narrative of Scripture and being able to show how we see Jesus in every book of the Bible.<\/p>\n<p>Some helpful resources from The Gospel Coalition on these topics include the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Essay:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/essay\/christ-in-the-old-testament\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christ in the Old Testament<\/a> by Stephen M.

      "rendered": "<p>I had just started a new job at my church. I was partly responsible for college ministry and my boss was out of town, so he asked me to use his truck to pick up students from campus and bring them to church.<\/p>\n<p>Sunday came. I picked up and dropped off the students, then headed to the back of the church to park the truck. Suddenly, I heard a dreaded, nails-on-a-chalkboard sound: me creating two long scratches along the side of his formerly pristine truck.<\/p>\n<p>My heart raced. <em>Had I ruined my relationship with my boss on one of my first weeks on the job? Could I repay him for the damage?<\/em> Not likely, given my seminary-student budget. But I knew there was no way around it. I had to tell him what happened. I got out my phone, texted to say what happened, apologized, and offered to pay for the damage. And then I waited . . .<\/p>\n<p>He texted back, \u201cNo problem, David! These things happen. I hope the morning went well!\u201d My fear was relieved by his forgiveness. A couple of weeks later, he asked me to use his truck to pick up students <em>again<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It may seem like a trivial example, but when I reflect on that day, it reminds me of a particular psalm.<\/p>\n<h3>\u2018I Kept Silent\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>In Psalm 32, David describes how he felt before confessing his sin to God: \u201cFor when I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer\u201d (Ps. 32:3\u20134). Today we might say something is \u201ceating us up inside\u201d or that we feel \u201ccrushed by guilt.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Do you ever feel like that? I do all the time. I have that thought again, speak those words again, or do that thing again. Then comes the crushing weight of shame. When we feel this way, it&#8217;s tempting to respond as David does here. We ignore, rationalize, or hide our sin. We keep silent before God. Our prayer goes to zero.<\/p>\n<p>But we can\u2019t hide our sin from him. Such attempts only lead to feeling dried up, our spiritual bones wasting away.<\/p>\n<h3>\u2018I Acknowledged My Sin to You\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>The good news is this isn\u2019t where the psalm ends. We don\u2019t have to spend our lives in the misery of verses 3\u20134. Psalm 32 ends with rejoicing (v. 11). So how do we get from the agony of verse 3 to the joy of verse 11, from feeling God\u2019s heavy hand to experiencing his blessing?<\/p>\n<p>The key is verse 5: \u201cI acknowledged my sin to you.\u201d It\u2019s that simple! David moves from silence before God (v. 3) to speaking to God (v. 5)\u2014from covering his sin to acknowledging his sin and letting God cover it (v. 1). The secret to experiencing God&#8217;s blessing is to own your sin before him.<\/p>\n<p>And this change\u2014from silence to speaking, from hiding to owning\u2014is what brings about one of my favorite lines in the entire book of Psalms: \u201cAnd you forgave the iniquity of my sin\u201d (v. 5). I love that there\u2019s zero space between David\u2019s confession and God\u2019s forgiveness. Confession is met with instant forgiveness\u2014no hesitation, no delay.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Confession is met with instant forgiveness\u2014no hesitation, no delay.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s radical forgiveness. When I texted my boss, I had to wait 45 agonizing minutes for his gracious reply. But with God, there\u2019s no wait, no \u201c. . .\u201d in his text response, no pause for him to think. There\u2019s no \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you as long as it\u2019s not too bad\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll forgive some things, but not that.\u201d Just pure, unqualified pardon.<\/p>\n<h3>Costly Forgiveness<\/h3>\n<p>Now, maybe you\u2019re thinking, <em>That\u2019s great, but you don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done. If you knew me\u2014if you knew the darkness inside\u2014you wouldn\u2019t be so sure.<\/em> Here\u2019s why I&#8217;m sure: God&#8217;s forgiveness doesn&#8217;t finally depend on you. The pardon he offers has nothing to do with what you have or haven\u2019t done but everything to do with what <em>he<\/em> has done.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The pardon he offers has nothing to do with what you have or haven\u2019t done but everything to do with what <em>he<\/em> has done.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve done, but I know what God has done in Christ. His life, death, and resurrection are the golden key that unlocks the wonder of Psalm 32. Jesus experienced the heavy hand of God so you might experience his mercy. He groaned and cried out in agony so you might shout for joy. He was shamed so you might rejoice. His strength was dried up so you might have life. He willingly gave his life so that now, because of his death in your place, you can be forgiven no matter what. You can drop the weight of sin and shame because Jesus will carry it for you.<\/p>\n<h3>\u2018Shout for Joy!\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>David concludes with a ringing call: \u201cBe glad in the LORD, and rejoice, O righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!\u201d (v. 11).<\/p>\n<p>He goes from groaning to shouting for joy, from feeling God\u2019s heavy hand to rejoicing, from his bones wasting away to being glad in the Lord\u2014all because he simply turned to God with his sin. Acknowledge your sin to him today, friend, and then rejoice with David: \u201cBlessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven!\u201d<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>The room was dark and the lights were dim. For months I (Jamaal) had wanted to visit this church. After sitting down, I felt weird because I didn\u2019t see another person of color there and because I was the only person in a suit (I\u2019d come straight from preaching at a local black church). But I was also excited. The church had a reputation not only for faithfulness to Scripture but also for contributing to the community.<\/p>\n<p>The service was spiritually uplifting. I was spiritually fed, and I could see why people spoke highly of the church. Then, after the sermon, something strange happened.<\/p>\n<p>People started walking to the front of the sanctuary, just like the congregants in my historically black church did during offering. But this wasn\u2019t time to tithe. They were going to the front to take and eat; it was time for communion.<\/p>\n<p>Those participating in communion tore off a piece of bread from a common loaf. They then dipped the bread in wine or juice. Finally, they ate as they returned to their seats. The way this church practiced communion was initially off-putting to me. I&#8217;m too concerned about hygiene to drink after anyone. Why would I eat bread torn from a loaf 500 other people have touched?<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, their communion service that day underscored a powerful spiritual reality. It was a tangibly gritty reminder of what Jesus did not only in his death but also in his ministry. Communion is a powerful apologetic for the gospel, an apologetic that depends less on how your church serves the communion elements and more on the beautiful diversity of people God brings together at the table.<\/p>\n<h3>Communion Is Not a Place for Division<\/h3>\n<p>Some congregations rip the bread and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/case-for-intinction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dip it<\/a> while others <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/case-against-intinction\/\">disagree with that practice<\/a>. Some faithful churches drink from a common cup, and still others use prepackaged wafers and juice. We&#8217;re not interested here in defending one particular way of conducting a communion service. But we do want you to see that when first-century Christians gathered for communion, the diversity of those who gathered was a testimony to the truth of the gospel.<\/p>\n<p>Early Christians shared an <i>agape<\/i> meal or \u201clove feast\u201d\u2014an entire meal that included the Lord\u2019s Supper. The meal was meant as a time of fellowship. But for the church in Corinth, the meal became a source of division. The problem in Corinth was that the higher social classes treated the Christian love feast like a pagan banquet. The wealthy ate first and consumed the finest parts of the meal, then the socially and economically disadvantaged went hungry (v. 21). At best, they scraped a meal together from the leftovers.<\/p>\n<p>In response, Paul tells the people they\u2019re despising the church and undermining the gospel. When instituting the Lord\u2019s Supper, Christ said,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. . . . This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. (1 Cor. 11:24\u201325)<\/p>\n<p>This \u201cremembrance\u201d included Christ\u2019s sufferings, but it wasn\u2019t limited to Christ\u2019s sufferings. It also remembered what he taught and how he lived. Jesus spent his life serving the marginalized, the overlooked, and the diseased (Mark 1:32\u201334; 2:15\u201317; 7:26\u201330). To celebrate the Lord\u2019s Supper in a way that reinforces classism or segregation rejects the meal\u2019s meaning. In the Corinthian church, the Lord\u2019s Supper had come to defeat its very purpose.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>To celebrate the Lord\u2019s Supper in a way that reinforces classism or segregation rejects the meal\u2019s meaning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s why Paul charges the Corinthians with sinning against the \u201cbody and blood of the Lord\u201d (1 Cor. 11:27). He commands, \u201cWhen you come together to eat, welcome one another\u201d (v. 33, CSB), meaning honor one another by eating together, making sure the haves and the have-nots enjoy the same meal. Then and now, communion is a reminder that Christ has broken down the barriers between us in his body and through his blood.<\/p>\n<h3>Witness of a Diverse Communion<\/h3>\n<p>What would Paul say if he toured your city and stopped in a few churches on Sunday? Would he see people from the same ethnicity and same socioeconomic class eating this ancient meal? Or do your communion tables bring together the tax collector and the zealot, the hip-hop-culture kid and the Latino immigrant, the bank president and the hotel maid?<\/p>\n<p>Neighborhoods in our city (Louisville, Kentucky) are racially divided. The neighborhoods in your city are probably similar. These divisions shape people\u2019s habits, which in turn shape their lives. White lives don\u2019t naturally intersect with black lives, and we don\u2019t naturally develop diverse relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the ethnic divisions fragmenting our world, a multiethnic community of faith participating in communion together pictures the gospel\u2019s unifying power. When a church is filled with a multiplicity of ethnicities, the world glimpses something supernatural at work, regardless of whether they admit what they&#8217;re seeing. A diverse church doesn\u2019t prove the full truth of the gospel, but it does call into question secular explanations of how such a community can be formed and sustained.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When a church is filled with a multiplicity of ethnicities, the world glimpses something supernatural at work, regardless of whether they admit what they&#8217;re seeing.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Nearly a decade after my first overdressed communion at that church with the common cup, I became the lead pastor there. At first, my germophobic tendencies kept me from appreciating how Sojourn Church Midtown practiced communion, but it eventually grew on me. There\u2019s something powerful about watching everyone come forward and partake of the same bread.<\/p>\n<p>And now, years later, there\u2019s something even more powerful in seeing a multiethnic, multisocioeconomic, multigenerational congregation take communion together. By God\u2019s grace, at Sojourn Church Midtown we&#8217;ve seen a growth in diversity, and every time we take communion we get hungrier for the marriage supper of the Lamb.<\/p>\n<p>Little by little, God is filling our church with people who have a variety of shades of skin, and we\u2019re thankful. We\u2019ve come a long way, but Lord knows we still have a long way to go.<\/p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a reason not a lot of people live in the Amazon. The world\u2019s largest rainforest is also one of its most aggressive physical environments\u2014certainly the most aggressive I\u2019ve ever experienced.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After flying on a puddle jumper into a remote village, a small group of us walked down to the Amazon River, where a couple of long, motorized canoes awaited us. We climbed in, each of us carrying a small backpack with filtered water bottles, miscellaneous snacks, a change of clothes, and a small camping hammock.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We started down the river with a couple of indigenous men who would be our guides and become our friends on the journey, and we soon found ourselves walled in by dense undergrowth and towering trees. Occasionally, a clearing opened to reveal homes nestled together on the riverbanks. The dwellings were made of plaster with metal roofs. But as we traveled deeper into the interior, any signs of village life became few and far between.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once deep in the heart of the rainforest, we arrived at the starting point for our trek. Our guides beached and secured the boats, then we hoisted our packs and started walking.<\/p>\n<h3>Entering the Amazon<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within seconds, we were swarmed by more species of biting and stinging insects than I knew existed. And those bugs were hungry! I wore long pants and a long-sleeved shirt, but somehow they still made their way through my clothes to feast on my flesh. I\u2019d been told to spray a lot of DEET on my clothes, which I\u2019d done with the utmost care, but evidently, these bugs eat DEET for breakfast.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bugs were a nuisance, for sure, but I was far more concerned about the jaguars and venomous snakes I\u2019d read about in preparation for this trip. Were they hiding in the thick brush, just waiting to strike? The indigenous guides (who, by the way, were trekking in sandals and shorts, often without shirts) tried to encourage us. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d they said through a translator. \u201cThe most dangerous animals sleep during the day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was comforting\u2014during the day. But it didn\u2019t exactly alleviate my anxiety about the night, when the jaguars and snakes would be most awake and I&#8217;d be least conscious, dangling in a hammock like dinner on a platter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After hiking for hours through the forest, we arrived at our campsite and hung our hammocks between trees. (With tarantulas and other critters crawling around, the ground wasn\u2019t an ideal place to sleep.) When it was time to retire for the night, we climbed into the cocoons of our hammocks, pulled mosquito nets over our bodies, and cinched them behind our heads. While I was thankful for the protection from the bugs, I knew that net wasn\u2019t posing any threat to a jaguar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I closed my eyes and prayed against jaguar hunger, I discovered the sanctifying experience of simply falling asleep in the Amazon. Lying there in the pitch-black dark, you can\u2019t see your hand in front of your face, but you can hear everything\u2014and the Amazon comes alive at night. You hear rustling above and below, the whines, buzzes, and clicks of insects nearby, and the lunatic roaring of howler monkeys in the distance. I prayed one prayer over and over again until I fell asleep: \u201cOh God, please get me through this night.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following morning, I woke with boundless gratitude for daylight breaking through the trees. I\u2019d made it, and so had all my fellow travelers. An hour or so later, we were on our way.<\/p>\n<h3>Learning About Jesus<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each day, we hiked, and each evening, we sat around a campfire with our guides\u2014truly amazing men who call the rainforest home. Together we ate noodles cooked over an open fire. To the soundtrack of crackling wood and the jungle life all around us, these men shared fascinating stories about their families, their ancestry, and their way of life in one of the most remote places on earth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night, after we\u2019d listened raptly to their tales, Bieto, one of our guides, asked me whether I had any good stories to share. I was glad to oblige, and I told them four short stories from Mark 4\u20135 about how the Creator of this rainforest had come to the world as a man named Jesus and how he had power over nature, evil spirits, disease, and death.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following night around the fire, another of the guides, Luan, recalled the stories I\u2019d shared. \u201cWhen you were telling those stories,\u201d he said, \u201cI had an unusual feeling inside, like my heart was beating out of my chest.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When you were telling those stories, I had an unusual feeling inside, like my heart was beating out of my chest.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThese stories have that kind of effect on people,\u201d I said. Then my fellow trekkers and I took turns sharing the larger story of the Bible\u2014the good news of how Jesus lived a sinless life, died a sacrificial death for sinners, and rose from the grave in victory over death.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the last night of the trek, Bieto spoke up again. \u201cWhen you share these stories about Jesus, I feel like I have a dirty heart. Is there a way my heart can be made clean?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat\u2019s the good news about Jesus,\u201d I said. \u201cThe reason he came was to give us a totally new heart.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s when Luan said words I&#8217;ll never forget. \u201cThese stories about Jesus are so good,\u201d he said with wonderment. \u201cAnd they seem so important. I just don\u2019t understand why we and our tribes and all our ancestors before us have never heard them until now.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Cause of Gospel Poverty<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider Luan\u2019s question: Why do you think approximately 3.2 billion men, women, and children like these men and their families have never heard the good news of Jesus?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My contention is simple. While many factors contribute to \u201cgospel poverty\u201d in jungles, villages, and megacities around the world, one of the primary reasons\u2014if not the primary reason\u2014that billions of people remain unreached by the gospel is that the global purpose of God has always faced resistance from the nationalistic people of God.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The global purpose of God has always faced resistance from the nationalistic people of God.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the nation of Israel in the Old Testament to the early church in the New Testament to the current church in the United States, people of God have continually desired the preservation of their nation more than the proclamation of the gospel in all nations. And just as generations of God\u2019s people before us needed to do, God is calling us to place less priority on our beloved home country\u2014a country that will one day fall\u2014and more priority on a global kingdom that will last forever. Not only is doing so urgent for billions of people in need of the gospel, but it&#8217;s also necessary in order to overcome sickness in the church.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s time for us as the people of God to recalibrate our priorities and realize our purpose. Whether you\u2019re a student, a senior adult, or anywhere in between, it&#8217;s right to praise God for the gifts he&#8217;s given you and me in a country that has freedom, resources, and opportunity like no other in the world. It&#8217;s good to pass on these gifts to the next generation of Americans. Yet it&#8217;s infinitely more important, satisfying, and unifying to give our lives to passing on the good news of Jesus to the Bietos and 3 billion others whose eternity hinges on hearing and believing the gospel.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Twenty years ago, I taught a seminary course in which I gave the students an in-class assignment. I had them jot down a list of their favorite theologians from throughout church history. Then I asked them to identify the ones who worked primarily in ecclesial vocations (as pastors, bishops, and other teachers of the church).<\/p>\n<p>This proved to be a life-changing exercise for many. When I asked the students to share what they\u2019d written, names like Irenaeus, Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, Edwards, Spurgeon, and King echoed across the room. When the students stopped and considered how many of these individuals worked primarily as clergy, my point was made before the lecture began.<\/p>\n<h3>Change<\/h3>\n<p>Most people from church history who continue to inform Christian thinking today worked mainly as ministers in ecclesial settings. Some taught from time to time in Christian colleges and seminaries. Most wrote books. But they spent the bulk of their time with their parishioners, preparing to teach and preach in ways that met their daily needs, helping them to do all Jesus had commanded, and praying God would bless their efforts for his glory.<\/p>\n<p>During the past two centuries, things have changed. Christians today don\u2019t look primarily to pastors as their most important intellectual guides. Professional academics and social media influencers have usurped the role clergy formerly played.<\/p>\n<p>There are understandable reasons why this has occurred, and we can\u2019t simply return to how things were before. But neither should pastors see this as a reason to abdicate their charge to serve the whole counsel of God\u2019s Word to God\u2019s people. There are modern ways for pastors to take the lead once again in renewing and informing the intellectual lives of God\u2019s people.<\/p>\n<h3>Reasons<\/h3>\n<p>In the wake of the Enlightenment, when Christendom dissolved, modern research universities rose to great prominence, and technological changes facilitated democratizing trends across the globe, the clergy began to lose the cultural authority they&#8217;d formerly taken for granted.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Christians today don\u2019t look primarily to pastors as their most important intellectual guides. Professional academics and social media influencers have usurped the role clergy formerly played.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Luther and Edwards enjoyed legally sanctioned status as intellectual leaders. The laity were expected, often required, to attend and support their teaching ministries. People\u2019s livelihoods and prospects depended on compliance with the state-church structures that organized their worlds. As a result, pastors could serve most citizens a well-balanced diet of divine revelation, interpreting and applying it to the struggles of their everyday lives.<\/p>\n<p>When these state-church structures were removed, however, the laity no longer had to eat what they disliked. Church leaders now had to use <em>voluntary<\/em> means to gain a hearing from the public. It\u2019s hard to persuade those who don\u2019t have to be there\u2014who don\u2019t have to do anything they don\u2019t like\u2014to choose intellectual effort and theological nourishment in Sunday morning services. It\u2019s easier to draw a crowd and hold their attention with the biblical equivalent of fast food, pandering to unhealthy tastes.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what many evangelical churches did. As a result, over time, most people looking for experts on life\u2019s big questions went elsewhere for nourishment. They consulted academics and public intellectuals with big media footprints.<\/p>\n<p>The consequences for everyday discipleship and witness have been tragic. Surveys show most Christians today are theologically illiterate, malnourished by the people called to feed them.<\/p>\n<h3>Charge<\/h3>\n<p>Our churches need pastors who will lead theologically. \u201cFor though by this time [our laypeople] ought to be teachers, [they] need someone to teach [them] again the basic principles of the oracles of God\u201d (Heb. 5:12).<\/p>\n<p>We can\u2019t go back in time. Nor do many of us want to. The specialization of disciplines in modern universities and growth in human knowledge during the last two centuries have proved a mixed blessing, but a blessing nonetheless. We now know more about the Bible, the history of Christianity, and the world than we did before.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll always need schools to offer specialized training to our ministerial leaders. Seminaries especially offer such a rich curriculum of specialized studies in subjects that pertain to our Christian lives and ministries\u2014Hebrew, Greek, church history, philosophy, psychology, hermeneutics, intercultural studies, and more\u2014that it\u2019s hard to think of teaching God\u2019s people without them.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Surveys show most Christians today are theologically illiterate, malnourished by the people called to feed them.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But the kind of education God\u2019s people need today is too important to be left to academics and other non-ecclesial thinkers. Such people often hold to Christian orthodoxy lightly, if they value it at all. Their work is often energized by secular concerns. They\u2019re motivated by tenure and promotion within their schools, fame and fortune in the media. They\u2019re not driven mainly by the needs of church people.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s work for a day when professors in the seminaries deem themselves handmaids to pastor-theologians\u2014and pastor-theologians take the lead in informing God\u2019s people theologically. Pastors are generalists. They\u2019ll always have to rely on the findings of experts as they carry out their work. But they ought to be the first stop for people who are wrestling with life\u2019s biggest questions.<\/p>\n<p>The Lord has told us to feed people the whole feast of faith\u2014vegetables and all. Let\u2019s help one another be faithful to the task. The vitality of the church depends upon it.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Is it sinful to change your place of employment based on pay alone?<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a great question. As God\u2019s people, we\u2019re called to live with different priorities than the world around us. We\u2019re called to live for God\u2019s kingdom, not our own. We\u2019re called to prioritize faithfulness over success, obedience over wealth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, the decision to change your place of employment based on pay alone may still have acceptable\u2014and even godly\u2014reasons behind it. Here are two important questions a Christian should consider first.<\/p>\n<h4>1. How will a job change affect your ability to live for God\u2019s mission?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider your work relationships. If you\u2019ve established meaningful connections with your coworkers, a job change will affect those relationships. Where is God moving? Are there people at your workplace he\u2019s calling you to care for and witness to? Of course, there are people to reach wherever you go\u2014but it\u2019s worth considering your current relationships.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I once changed jobs based on pay alone. I provided in-home therapy for a boy with autism and had worked with him three to four days a week for eight years. He was like family, so leaving was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done. It felt like a betrayal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there was an important reason I chose to leave. His school district would no longer fund the type of therapy I provided. They offered to keep me on as an aide, a position that would decrease my pay by 60 percent. I <em>wanted<\/em> to stay. I deeply loved the boy I worked with and vehemently disagreed (as did the family) with the school district\u2019s decision. But my husband and I were in the midst of paying for an international adoption. He was already working extra hours, and we depended on the income I contributed. I just couldn\u2019t take a 60 percent pay cut when we were already struggling to cover adoption expenses.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>As God\u2019s people, we\u2019re called to live with different priorities than the world around us.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted to help ease the transition as best as I could. So I worked at the reduced rate for the summer, before taking a new job that offered much better pay. I anguished over the decision. And unfortunately, I think the family saw it as a betrayal. It looked like my decision was just about money, because in a way it <em>was<\/em> just about money. We had to make sacrifices to complete our adoption, and the deepest sacrifice I made was leaving a job\u2014and a boy\u2014I loved.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So maybe you should leave, but don\u2019t leave lightly. Consider the people you\u2019re leaving behind.<\/p>\n<h4>2. What&#8217;s driving your desire for more money?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money itself isn\u2019t bad. It helps provide for our families, bless our neighbors, feed the hungry, and build the church. We\u2019re not called to take vows of poverty but rather to use whatever we\u2019ve been entrusted with to serve the Lord. God will give some of us opportunities to make more money than others, because he calls us to stewardship in a diversity of ways. Yet we also must remember this warning:<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. (1 Tim. 6:9\u201310)<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This passage should sober us. We must humbly recognize our own weakness. None of us is above the temptation to wander from the faith in pursuit of riches. Just like every other temptation, greed is subtle, stealthy. It\u2019s not going to be obvious at first.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take time to pray for the Holy Spirit\u2019s help and conviction. Humbly evaluate your motives: Are you excited to grow as a faithful steward, or are you chasing your own comfort? Seek counsel from godly brothers and sisters in Christ. The temptations associated with money are too dangerous to face alone.<\/p>\n<h3>Remember, Only Jesus Satisfies<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those who\u2019ve been given the privilege of opportunities and choices, it\u2019s tempting to continually be on the hunt for something more. But exploring \u201cbetter options\u201d can become a maddening rabbit hole.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing jobs for a better salary might yield new challenges. Sure, the money is better. But maybe the boss or the schedule or the workload isn\u2019t. Whether you decide to leave or stay, remember that true contentment and satisfaction and fulfillment will only ever be found in Christ.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>I was in my late 20s when a pastor in my local church called and asked if I would teach a Wednesday night class. I was terrified. But I said yes because he told me he thought I could do it, and he said he would help.<\/p>\n<p>We met at McDonald&#8217;s, and he walked me through his plan for the class. He told me to teach as long as I wanted, and then he would wrap up the class when I finished. So I studied and prepared all week long. I wrote out my lesson. When that Wednesday night arrived, I was nervous. I took my prepared lesson, taught for five minutes, and sat down. The pastor must have been a bit shocked and even ill-prepared to carry the last 45 minutes, but he never made me feel bad or even hinted that my five minutes wasn\u2019t the contribution he was looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Despite how little I brought to the table, this pastor allowed me to continue teaching. My five-minute offering grew, and, eventually, I was invited to teach some Sunday school classes and weekly Bible studies. The first women\u2019s retreats I spoke at were born out of these opportunities. As women moved away, they began to call and ask if I would come teach at their new churches&#8217; women\u2019s retreats.<\/p>\n<p>When I look back, I see two elements that helped me discern areas of gifting and grow in my ability to use those gifts. First, it took an invitation from someone significantly more experienced in ministry\u2014my pastor. Second, he offered encouragement and real help.<\/p>\n<h3>We Need Help Discerning Our Gifts<\/h3>\n<p>God is on an epic, global, eternal mission to seek and save the lost. He&#8217;s forming a people for himself, and he uses his people to accomplish this grand mission. He uses the old and the young, the rich and the poor, people from every nation and language\u2014and he uses both men and women.<\/p>\n<p>When we look back to Eden, we see God had created a world that was very good. But there was one thing in Eden that wasn&#8217;t good. It was \u201cnot good that the man should be alone.&#8221; So God said, &#8220;I will make him a helper fit for him\u201d (Gen. 2:18). God created Eve to help Adam fulfill the mandate to fill the whole earth with other image-bearers. Adam couldn&#8217;t have done that alone, and, in a similar way, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/reviews\/empowered-equipped-higgins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">women are still vital<\/a> to the fulfillment of God\u2019s mission to go into all the earth and make disciples. One way women do that is by teaching and discipling other women in the local church.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For me to start teaching, it took an invitation from someone significantly more experienced in ministry\u2014my pastor.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But when it comes to leadership and teaching, women may be particularly hesitant to put themselves forward. Many leaders and teachers in women\u2019s ministry have stories similar to mine. They only started serving in these ways because someone in their local church saw potential and asked them to give it a try. We need the body of Christ to help us discern our gifts.<\/p>\n<h3>We Need Help Honing Our Gifts<\/h3>\n<p>My pastor not only helped me identify my gifting by inviting me to teach but also helped me develop it. He gave me ample opportunity to try, fail, get help, and try again. We all need space to learn and grow. One of my seminary professors observed that most of us have far too few opportunities to receive meaningful feedback on our teaching. What this pastor gave me was invaluable!<\/p>\n<p>As we seek to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/podcasts\/help-me-teach-the-bible\/teaching-women-teach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hone the gift of teaching<\/a>, two things are particularly beneficial: feedback and continuing education. In other words, we always need to keep learning.<\/p>\n<p>When I teach, I\u2019ve found it helpful to ask for feedback in three areas: structure, content, and delivery. Was the structure clear and helpful? Did it follow the structure of the text? Was the content solid, true, and from the text? And was anything about my delivery distracting?<\/p>\n<p>But we don\u2019t just need to learn about our teaching\u2014we also need to continue to grow in our understanding of Scripture. This can happen formally (through seminary or Bible college) or informally (through reading good theological resources and discussing them with a pastor or ministry leader).<\/p>\n<p>At The Gospel Coalition, we periodically offer an eight-week cohort called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/blogs\/melissa-kruger\/announcing-new-womens-cohort-how-to-teach-the-bible\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Teach the Bible<\/a>.\u201d This cohort is designed to help women gain and sharpen the tools needed to teach. Even if we know the basics, we can always be challenged to apply that knowledge in new ways. I don\u2019t think we ever \u201carrive\u201d as Bible teachers. Some of the best Bible teachers you and I know still ask for feedback, still pursue learning, and still practice honing their skills.<\/p>\n<h3>How Pastors Can Help<\/h3>\n<p>My pastor was instrumental in helping me identify and develop my gift of teaching, and all pastors have the opportunity to help women in their churches.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My pastor was instrumental in helping me identify and develop my gift of teaching, and all pastors have the opportunity to help women in their churches.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps there\u2019s a woman who&#8217;s gifted to teach but needs to be offered an opportunity. Perhaps there are women who are already teaching who would benefit from feedback and encouragement. Even something as simple as offering access to commentaries and theology books could be a huge help as they continue to learn and grow. Or maybe the church could pay for women to attend a TGC cohort or seminary class.<\/p>\n<p>Women are a vital part of God\u2019s mission to seek and save the lost. Let\u2019s help identify, equip, and encourage those who are gifted to lead and teach. And may many women be strengthened and established in their faith as a result.<\/p>\n",

Facing his third threat of expulsion toward the end of high school, he planned to ask God to rescue him again.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_553326\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-553326\" style=\"width: 1000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-553326\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/02095836\/ken-and-arlette.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/02095836\/ken-and-arlette.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/02095836\/ken-and-arlette-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/02095836\/ken-and-arlette-768x512.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-553326\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ken Mbugua and his wife, Arlette \/ Courtesy of Arlette Mbugua&#8217;s Facebook page<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI started thinking that I was going to pray to the King, to the Father, but I loved the stuff he hates,\u201d Mbugua said. \u201cI boasted about it. I was famous for it. And I liked it.\u201d That\u2019s when it dawned on him: <em>I don&#8217;t have a relationship with God. He isn&#8217;t my Father. He isn&#8217;t really my King. <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI cried out to God and asked him to save me\u2014and everything changed,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outline of Mbugua\u2019s story is a familiar one in the capital city of Nairobi. It\u2019s also familiar to anyone who experienced the United States in the 1950s and \u201960s, when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.govinfo.gov\/content\/pkg\/USCOURTS-ca4-15-02597\/pdf\/USCOURTS-ca4-15-02597-3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more than 90 percent<\/a> of the population identified as Christian. Most adult conversions then weren\u2019t people who had never heard of Jesus but rather those who tipped into believing the salvation story they&#8217;d already memorized.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are other similarities. America and Kenya both share a penchant for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/what-you-should-know-about-the-prosperity-gospel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">health-and-wealth theology<\/a>, which began as a Pentecostal offshoot in post\u2013World War II America and established itself through Trinity Broadcasting Network television preachers in both countries.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And increasingly, they share the Reformed resurgence. Kenyan pastors are beginning to quote Calvinist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/273082412_Tertullianus_Totus_Noster_Calvin%27s_Use_Of_Tertullian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">theologians<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/timothykeller.com\/blog\/2014\/3\/1\/saint-augustine-on-prayer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pastors<\/a> (who often quote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/reformation-african-roots\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">African theologians<\/a> such as <a href=\"https:\/\/africa.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/fathers-of-the-reformation-africans-in-the-early-church\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tertullian<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.desiringgod.org\/messages\/for-men-augustine-sin-and-sovereign-joy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Augustine<\/a>).

There is a hunger\u2014a continued and sustained hunger\u2014for truth, for a God who is transcendent above all the trifling.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Christianity on the Continent<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christianity came late to sub-Saharan Africa, smoldering for generations as it slowly worked its way from the coasts inland. And then, in the 1900s, the whole place caught fire.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 1900 to 2020, the number of Christians skyrocketed from about 7 million to about 645 million\u2014in other words, from about 9 percent of the population to just about 60 percent, according to the World Religion Database.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/religion\/2010\/04\/15\/executive-summary-islam-and-christianity-in-sub-saharan-africa\/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-552672 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/25115134\/Image-4-11-23-at-9.40-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1307\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/25115134\/Image-4-11-23-at-9.40-AM.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/25115134\/Image-4-11-23-at-9.40-AM-300x196.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/25115134\/Image-4-11-23-at-9.40-AM-768x502.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The growth doesn\u2019t show signs of stopping. By 2050, the number of Christians in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/religion\/2015\/04\/02\/sub-saharan-africa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top a billion<\/a>\u2014which would mean that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/religion\/2015\/04\/02\/religious-projections-2010-2050\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">four out of every 10<\/a> Christians on the planet would call sub-Saharan Africa home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt is the fruit of initial missionary work that took place from the 19th century into the early 20th century,\u201d said TGC Africa Council member and Zambian pastor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/profile\/conrad-mbewe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conrad Mbewe<\/a>. \u201cAnd then in the first fifty years of the 20th century, churches and missions work were handed over to indigenous leaders, who took the ball and ran with it. They saw it as their responsibility to share the gospel message with others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps that there hasn\u2019t been a lot of government or societal opposition in Kenya, he said. Even if you don\u2019t believe in Jesus, it\u2019s easy to feel kindly toward a religion that so publicly cares for the sick and educates the children.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, hey, maybe it can make you rich.<\/p>\n<h3>Prosperity Theology<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1990s, preachers like Benny Hinn and Creflo Dollar appeared on African televisions and scratched just the right cultural itch.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those in poverty are nearly always hungry for promises of wealth, Kenyan pastor Christian Lwanda said. And those promises sometimes seemed to pay off\u2014while African poverty <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/extreme-poverty-concentrates-in-sub-saharan-africa-1537243201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">isn&#8217;t dropping<\/a> as quickly as in other areas of the world, conditions are improving.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPeople would start hearing this stuff at church, and a certain number of them were already working hard or good at business,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you are crediting your upward mobility to this new gospel. And pastors could point to these businessmen\u2014look how they thrived because of this prosperity gospel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even more importantly, the prosperity gospel\u2019s focus on manifesting reality fits well with African culture, he said. \u201cIn African traditional religions, you have a kind of mystic, spiritualistic understanding of the world\u2014an animistic cosmology.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>From 1900 to 2020, the number of Christians skyrocketed from about 7 million to about 645 million\u2014in other words, from about 9 percent of the population to just about 60 percent.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animism teaches that humans need to \u201cdiscover what beings and forces are influencing them in order to determine future action and, frequently, to manipulate their power,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imb.org\/2018\/10\/26\/africa-animism-prosperity-gospel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes<\/a> Nick Moore, academic dean at the Baptist Theological Seminary of Zimbabwe. It\u2019s a payment system\u2014I do this, or say this, or believe this, and I\u2019ll get a reward.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why animism involves \u201ca lot of shouting, pleading, screaming, and emotion,\u201d Lwanda said. \u201cAnd here these prosperity guys are doing the same thing to ask God for what you need.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prosperity theology \u201cis like the Arabian camel that gave the impression it simply wanted a little space in the tent, but now the whole of it is inside and the true gospel is outside,\u201d Mbewe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/prosperity-teaching-has-replaced-true-gospel-in-africa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told<\/a> TGC. \u201cEverywhere, especially on radio and television, almost all you hear is this message about how God in Christ wants us to be physically healthy and materially prosperous.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s what Mbugua was watching and listening to when he became a Christian. \u201cMy most frequent prayer in the first year of being a believer was that the Lord would make me very wealthy as a businessman and that I\u2019d use all that money to get missionaries to go to the hardest places in Kenya that have not heard the gospel,\u201d he said. So when pastors in his life kept noticing his gift for ministry, he told God he wanted a sign.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you are calling me to be a pastor, let a child in my Vacation Bible School class become a Christian,\u201d he told God one summer. The next day, two girls in his class told the pastor\u2019s wife they wanted to become Christians.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThose don\u2019t count,\u201d Mbugua told God. \u201cIf you really want me to be a pastor, let <em>seven<\/em> kids tell<em> me<\/em> they want to become Christians.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the week, he asked the kids to raise their hands if they wanted to become Christians. Nine hands shot up. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even pray with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to step out because I was bawling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effective-atheist-turned-prosperity-Christian was headed to Bible college.<\/p>\n<h3>Theological Reformation of Ken Mbugua<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mbugua enrolled at a little Bible school in Nairobi. When he attended a Baptist pastors\u2019 conference a few months later, someone handed him a copy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Nine-Marks-Healthy-Church-9Marks\/dp\/1433578115?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Nine Marks of a Healthy Church<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Lord used it to expose me to the beauty of conversion\u2014to the much bigger doctrine of election\u2014and it really caught my heart,\u201d he said. The conference also introduced him to expository preaching.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_553434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-553434\" style=\"width: 289px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-553434 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/03063053\/scan0005-e1683109883716.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"289\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/03063053\/scan0005-e1683109883716.jpg 289w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/03063053\/scan0005-e1683109883716-201x300.jpg 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-553434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mbugua graduating from Central Africa Baptist University \/ Courtesy of Arlette Mbugua<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Realizing there was a lot more to learn than he\u2019d thought, Mbugua enrolled in Central Africa Baptist University in Zambia. There, a professor gave him a copy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Desiring-God-Revised-Meditations-Christian\/dp\/1601423101\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Desiring God<\/em><\/a>, and the little understanding he\u2019d had of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/reviews\/big-god\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">big God theology<\/a> exploded.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was like a rocket that disappears into the night sky,\u201d he said. \u201cThe school had a WiFi plan of six gigabytes per month, which is very little. My friend and I would download audio files from D. A. Carson\u2014I had so many D. A. Carson audio files\u2014and any other T4G [Together for the Gospel] or TGC speaker we could get our hands on. We downloaded John Frame\u2019s whole section of lectures on philosophy. Once we were done with classes, I\u2019d be on my earphones doing my chores while listening.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The classes were good, but it was the internet that gave Mbugua most of his Reformed theological education.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI graduated with my bachelors,\u201d he said, \u201cand went back to Kenya reformed.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Reformation in Nairobi<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kenya\u2019s location on the eastern coast of Africa\u2014and Nairobi\u2019s location at the railroad hub in the middle of the country\u2014make it an important economic and transportation center. That\u2019s maybe why Christianity grew so quickly, from 2 percent of the population in 1900 to more than 80 percent today, according to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when Mbugua returned to be a youth pastor at Emmanuel Baptist Church (EBC), he felt completely alone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI saw a vision for church and theology in my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I knew what was waiting for me in Kenya was wilderness.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His wife, Arlette, explains it like this: \u201cMany Kenyans think they can be saved by being a good person, going to church, or not being a Muslim. People aren\u2019t trusting in the death and resurrection of Jesus for their salvation. They\u2019re trusting in other things.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_552678\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-552678\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-552678\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25120732\/chris-at-rainy-night-bible-study.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25120732\/chris-at-rainy-night-bible-study.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25120732\/chris-at-rainy-night-bible-study-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25120732\/chris-at-rainy-night-bible-study-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-552678\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chris Kiagiri (right) teaching the Bible study on Romans \/ Courtesy of Chris Kiagiri<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months in, after a long week with kids at a summer camp, a tired Mbugua was forced by a rainstorm to accept a friend\u2019s invitation to a Bible study. He listened as a guy named Chris, who worked for Google, opened up the book of Romans and led a group of about 30 young professionals through an expository study.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mbugua just about fell off his chair.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m just like, <em>How in the world is there a group like this in the city I\u2019m serving?<\/em>\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He wasn\u2019t the only one wondering that. For a long time, the only Reformed Baptist church in Nairobi was Trinity, planted in the late 1970s by a British missionary named Keith Underhill. A few months earlier, two of the guys from the Romans Bible study found it and asked if they could become members.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underhill couldn\u2019t believe it, they reported. In more than 30 years of ministry, he\u2019d never met a single Reformed person in Nairobi that he hadn\u2019t personally taught about the doctrines of grace.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe new Calvinism explosion that was happening in the US\u2014TGC, T4G, Sovereign Grace music, Christian hip-hop\u2014all of that stuff was happening here at the same time,\u201d Mbugua said. It was also happening in the same way, through the internet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.christianitytoday.com\/ct\/2006\/september\/42.32.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">young, restless, and Reformed<\/a> in Kenya didn\u2019t have was a group of older men to teach and lead them. Or established churches besides Trinity. Or seminaries, conferences, and books.<\/p>\n<h3>Reformation of Emmanuel Baptist Church<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mbugua took a job as an assistant pastor at EBC, a primarily expatriate international church of about 150 members. The lead pastor, an American who had grown up in Kenya as a missionary kid, was generous in sharing the pulpit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHe knew my convictions were different from his, and he was open to say, \u2018Show me from the Bible,\u2019\u201d Mbugua said. \u201cThe places where we disagreed, he\u2019d say, \u2018Ken, you do those things when I leave.\u2019 He knew the church would change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, it was already changing. As Mbugua preached\u2014\u201cMy style was influenced by John Piper at that point\u201d\u2014it began resonating with pockets of people. The church grew.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_552680\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-552680\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-552680\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25120919\/dever-ken-and-chris.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25120919\/dever-ken-and-chris.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25120919\/dever-ken-and-chris-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25120919\/dever-ken-and-chris-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-552680\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mark Dever, Ken Mbugua, and Chris Kiagiri at a conference in South Africa in 2013 \/ Courtesy of Chris Kiagiri<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a conference in South Africa, Mbugua met Mark Dever. The next year, he flew to Washington, DC, to do the Capitol Hill Baptist Church internship, coming back with 9Marks ecclesiology and an American wife. Soon after, he became the lead pastor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ve watched the church culture change,\u201d his wife, Arlette, said. \u201cI\u2019d call it a revitalization.\u201d Mbugua introduced more meaningful church membership and discipline. He led the church to move from a single-pastor model to a plurality of elders. He focused on relationships and community, exhorting members to confess sin and to pray for one another.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s been a testament to the power of the gospel preached and the church led by faithful leaders,\u201d Arlette said. Former members \u201cwho would come back now would not recognize it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EBC gained a reputation for being gospel-centered. And since Mbugua was young and Kenyan, it started attracting those young Kenyans who were learning about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/course\/tulip-the-five-points-of-calvinism\/#introduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doctrines of grace<\/a> online.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey all wash up on the shores of Emmanuel Baptist Church,\u201d said Lwanda, who was one of them.

He started preaching the doctrines of grace in the church where he was serving. The congregants wanted more, but eventually the leaders recognized his trajectory was different from theirs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI went to EBC, and it was like a cold cup of water in the middle of the Arabian peninsula,\u201d said Lwanda, who now does ministry in the United Arab Emirates. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about Ken Mbugua\u2019s great patience. Many people had questions about this theology which they knew to be true but struggled to understand. He was never once impatient with the barrage of questions that came his way. He understood his context well enough to know that those poor sheep had been swimming in the cesspool of prosperity theology, and it would take great patience before they grasped these truths.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years, the EBC community became \u201crock solid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people have confidence\u2014I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever seen that before\u2014confidence that God will do whatever he wants, and they\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, EBC has shifted from about 70 percent international to 90 percent Kenyan. It has about 350 members, though weekly attendance often tops 450. (\u201cParking is a nightmare,\u201d Lwanda said, laughing. \u201cPeople are parking everywhere. They\u2019d park on trees if they could.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growth often provides doors of opportunity, and Mbugua started flinging them open.<\/p>\n<h3>Ekklesia Afrika<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe started an internship program, because who doesn\u2019t once you\u2019ve been with Mark Dever?\u201d Mbugua said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then EBC started planting. So far, they\u2019ve launched four churches\u2014all in different parts of Nairobi\u2014with another planned for 2023.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mbugua launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ekklesiaafrika.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ekklesia Afrika<\/a> in 2017, \u201cborn out of a burden to provide access to theological resources and wanting to see churches become healthier,\u201d he said. With copyrights from Crossway, he started printing ESV Bibles and titles such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Church-Membership-Represents-Building-Churches\/dp\/1433532379\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Church Membership<\/em><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Church-Discipline-Protects-Building-Churches\/dp\/1433532336\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Church Discipline<\/em><\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/What-Healthy-Church-IX-Marks\/dp\/1581349378\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>What is a Healthy Church?<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_552686\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-552686\" style=\"width: 1080px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-552686\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25122458\/ekklesia-afrika-panel-discussion.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"829\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25122458\/ekklesia-afrika-panel-discussion.jpeg 1080w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25122458\/ekklesia-afrika-panel-discussion-300x230.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/25122458\/ekklesia-afrika-panel-discussion-768x590.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-552686\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A panel on the Holy Spirit, the sovereignty of God, and traditional African religion at Ekklesia Afrika&#8217;s September conference \/ Courtesy of Ekklesia Afrika&#8217;s Facebook page<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before, books had to be purchased and flown in from another country. Now, Ekklesia is printing and distributing them in Nairobi, which makes them available and affordable. Over the last five years, they\u2019ve printed more than 100 titles.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step was obvious: \u201cWe organized them into a curriculum and made it a four-year program,\u201d Mbugua said. Pastors read a book a month\u2014David Helm on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ekklesiaafrika.org\/product-page\/expositional-preaching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expositional preaching<\/a>, Deepak Reju on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ekklesiaafrika.org\/product-page\/the-pastor-and-counseling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">counseling<\/a>, John Piper on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ekklesiaafrika.org\/product-page\/let-the-nations-be-glad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">missions<\/a>\u2014and then write an essay and discuss it twice a month with a learning cohort.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a continent with inadequate theological education, the program immediately grew numerically and geographically. Today, there are 1,108 Kenyan, Ugandan, South Sudanese, and Malawian pastors in the program.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s not the most ideal,\u201d Mbugua said. He\u2019d prefer full, in-person theological education. But, he continued, \u201cPeople are reading, discussing, and being exposed to the truth. This morning we talked about expository preaching, and one pastor said he needed to apologize to his church because for 18 years he hasn\u2019t been telling them what the Bible says. We\u2019ve even had some guys wanting to shut down their churches because they weren\u2019t sure their group of people was even functioning as a church.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The teaching is already making a difference. \u201cThere are now a lot more churches who are not Reformed but will have biblical sermons,\u201d said Chris Kiagiri, the Google manager who taught the Romans Bible study that surprised Mbugua. \u201cYou\u2019ll find among any number of nondenominational pastors a good number who would embrace the Reformed label, even if their churches wouldn\u2019t. And I\u2019m thankful for that.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Normalizing Reformed Theology<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seeds planted through the internet and watered by churches like EBC and ministries like Ekklesia Afrika are bearing fruit all over Nairobi.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_553435\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-553435\" style=\"width: 1333px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-553435\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/03063438\/IMG_1184-1-e1683110107182.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1333\" height=\"1490\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/03063438\/IMG_1184-1-e1683110107182.jpg 1333w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/03063438\/IMG_1184-1-e1683110107182-268x300.jpg 268w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/03063438\/IMG_1184-1-e1683110107182-768x858.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-553435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mbugua preaching at EBC \/ Courtesy of EBC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cInitially, everybody you\u2019d talk to would tell you they came to gospel-centered theology through people and places such as Piper, T4G, TGC, or Ligonier,\u201d Mbugua said. \u201cNow people are not saying that. Many are coming to these biblical truths through the African people who came to those truths before them. It seems to be a wave.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s especially true on college campuses, he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think good theology appeals to university students because it\u2019s rigorous and engages the mind,\u201d Kiagiri said. \u201cThere has been a rise in university fellowships trying to find guest preachers who are faithful expositors, including those at Trinity and Emmanuel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps that they &#8220;don\u2019t have to leave Kenya to attend a good Bible <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ekklesiaafrika.org\/event-details\/proclaim-conference-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conference<\/a> or to obtain good, affordable books,\u201d he said. \u201cReformed theology used to be a sort of strange thing for a very niche population of Christians. Now, while it\u2019s not mainstream, it\u2019s certainly something most Christians in Nairobi would be familiar with or have <a href=\"https:\/\/africa.thegospelcoalition.org\/podcasts\/tgc-africa-podcast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heard about<\/a>. That\u2019s all happened in the space of 15 years. Just this past week I dropped in on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ekklesiaafrika.org\/cst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simeon Trust workshop<\/a> at Emmanuel that had more than 100 pastors. I never thought I\u2019d see something like that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wave of good theology is also washing back in the other direction. Lwanda <a href=\"https:\/\/t4g.org\/speakers\/christian-lwanda\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spoke<\/a> at the T4G conference in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2022. Mbugua <a href=\"https:\/\/app.gettymusicworshipconference.com\/speaker\/ken-mbugua\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taught<\/a> at the Sing!

So the Reformed faith growing in that country means it will impact the rest of the region. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be living in Africa now feels like \u201cliving in a day of opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cLike Paul said, it\u2019s like a door has been opened for us in this region. And now the Lord is answering our prayers beyond what we were able to ask or imagine.\u201d<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>As we journey through life&#8217;s wilderness, there are times when our souls are obviously parched with thirst. Other times, we barely notice the drought. We ignore our need for spiritual refreshment and just keep moving. As women, it&#8217;s easy to focus on our next work deadline, our kid\u2019s next soccer game, or the next church event we\u2019re organizing without remembering we need the good news to replenish our souls.<\/p>\n<p>Women tackle hard issues day after day in a world that only grows more complex. We need refreshment. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/tgc23\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Gospel Coalition&#8217;s 2023 Conference<\/a> is a time to slow down and satiate our dry hearts with abundant reminders of the gospel\u2014giving ourselves sustenance in the wilderness as we await our true home.<\/p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s conference will feature more than 40 microevents. These sessions, led by different ministry partners, will allow attendees to explore specific topics in-depth.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a woman attending TGC23, you&#8217;ll benefit from many of these sessions. Here are just 8 microevents that might especially pique your interest.<\/p>\n<h3>1. For Women: Cultivating Your Gifts of Leading and Teaching<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Speakers:<\/strong> Courtney Doctor, Melissa Kruger, Rebecca McLaughlin, Jen Wilkin, Elizabeth Woodson<br \/>\n<strong>Hosted By:<\/strong> Lifeway Women<\/p>\n<p>Join several female theologians to celebrate and cultivate the gifts that God has placed in you to lead, teach the Bible, and create spaces for others to thrive. In this microevent, you\u2019ll be encouraged and equipped, and you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to connect with like-minded women. We\u2019ll tackle two topics that are part of every woman\u2019s leadership development journey: perseverance and preparation.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Hope (and Help!), for Women\u2019s Ministry<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Speakers:<\/strong> Ligon Duncan, Nancy Guthrie, Melissa Kruger, Leigh Swanson<br \/>\n<strong>Hosted By:<\/strong> Reformed Theological Seminary<\/p>\n<p>A strong theological foundation plays a vital role in encouraging and sustaining hope. This session provides practical advice and encouragement for pastors, elders, women\u2019s ministry leaders, and others who desire to start and sustain biblically faithful and theologically rich women\u2019s ministries in their congregations.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Gathered, Not Scattered: Parenting Toward a Shared Family Identity in an Age of Individualism<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Speaker:<\/strong> Jen Wilkin<br \/>\n<strong>Hosted By:<\/strong> Lifeway<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s family sits squarely in a world that values charting your own path, being your own person, and pursuing what makes you, the individual, most happy. Jen Wilkin helps us consider how this affects family relationships and how to regain a deep focus on the shared space we call home.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Shepherding Women in the Church<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Speakers:<\/strong> Courtney Doctor, Vanessa Hawkins, Melissa Kruger<br \/>\n<strong>Hosted By:<\/strong> The Gospel Coalition<\/p>\n<p>Women make up more than 50 percent of most congregations. Yet it can be hard for ministry leaders to know how to best support, encourage and care for them. Whether you\u2019re a pastor, a director of women\u2019s ministry, or someone who invests in the lives of the women in your local church, this session will discuss the best practices for supporting and caring for the women you\u2019ve been called to shepherd.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Hope, in Confusing Times and Suffering<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Speakers:<\/strong> James Anderson, Ligon Duncan, Nancy Guthrie<br \/>\n<strong>Hosted By:<\/strong> Reformed Theological Seminary<\/p>\n<p>Christians dwell as \u201csojourners and exiles\u201d (1 Pet. 2:11) in a world that&#8217;s increasingly complex to navigate while maintaining biblical convictions for faith and life. In this two-part session, James Anderson will begin by examining how to cultivate a biblically formed understanding of our present cultural realities\u2014and how such an understanding helps us maintain a confident and hopeful witness when we might otherwise be tempted to despair. Ligon Duncan and Nancy Guthrie will then follow with a discussion of theological foundations and pastoral approaches for helping our fellow brothers and sisters as they walk through suffering.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Pastoring School Choices<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Speakers:<\/strong> Winfree Brisley, Courtney Doctor, Jared Kennedy, Bill Kynes<br \/>\n<strong>Hosted By:<\/strong> The Gospel Coalition<\/p>\n<p>The education of our children is vitally important, but the decision about how to educate them can be challenging. As church leaders, you&#8217;re likely asked to help those in your sphere of influence navigate their educational decisions. Join us as we discuss the pros and cons of different choices as well as biblical principles that can help inform our decisions.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Raising Kids in Ministry: Insight from Pastors&#8217; Kids<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Speakers:<\/strong> Winfree Brisley, Megan Hill, Gavin Ortlund<br \/>\n<strong>Hosted By:<\/strong> The Gospel Coalition<\/p>\n<p>Are the kids going to be all right? Especially in ministry, we worry about raising kids who rebel wildly or who become perfectly behaved hypocrites, who buckle under the pressure of congregational expectations or who nurse life-long bitterness against the church. In this panel discussion, three grown-up pastors\u2019 kids (some now the parents of pastors\u2019 kids) discuss what their parents did well, what they wish was different, and how they\u2019d encourage ministry families today with the hope of Christ.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>8. Pilgrim\u2019s Perseverance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Speaker:<\/strong> Ruth Chou Simons<br \/>\n<strong>Hosted By:<\/strong> Harvest House<\/p>\n<p>Every pilgrim has a story about how God\u2019s ways, his character, and his attributes helped her press onward in her journey. Join Ruth Chou Simons to explore how beloved theological truths serve as guideposts of God\u2019s grace and presence for every journey, from beginning to end.<\/p>\n<p>This is just a small selection of the 40-plus microevents happening during the three days of the conference, On top of this, you\u2019ll hear excellent keynote speakers like John Piper, David Platt, and Miguel N\u00fa\u00f1ez, as well as worship led by\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">CityAlight from <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Sydney, Australia.

      "rendered": "<p>Before we had kids, my husband and I assumed our children would go to public schools just as we had. In the places we grew up, nearly everyone\u2014even in our churches\u2014went to public school. But by the time our oldest son was nearing kindergarten, how to educate your children had become a hot topic in Christian circles.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, our church had three pastors. One sent his children to public school, one sent his to private Christian school, and the third pastor\u2019s children were homeschooled. It was clear to us that education is an area of Christian freedom, but it wasn\u2019t clear to us what <em>we<\/em> should do.<\/p>\n<h3>What We\u2019ve Tried<\/h3>\n<p>We searched the Scriptures, we prayed about it, we read books like <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Perspectives-Your-Childs-Education-Publishing\/dp\/0805448446\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perspectives on Your Child\u2019s Education<\/a><\/em>, and we talked to older parents in our church who chose different school options. Did I mention I\u2019m a former teacher and had taught in both public and private Christian schools? Surely my experience would count for something. But at the end of it all, we still didn\u2019t have a clear conviction about how to educate our children.<\/p>\n<p>So we tried to apply wise decision-making principles and decided on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/perspectives-on-our-childrens-education-going-public\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public school<\/a> for Spanish language immersion. But a couple of years in, COVID hit and everything about our school experience changed. Given some new challenges, we decided to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/perspectives-on-our-childrens-education-homeward-bound\/?_gl=1*1ti152o*_ga*NDM2OTYyMTU2LjE2NTkwMzI0NTA.*_ga_R61P3F5MSN*MTY4MzAyMjgyNi4zNjUuMS4xNjgzMDIyODUyLjM0LjAuMA..\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">homeschool<\/a> while we considered our options.<\/p>\n<p>After a wonderful year of homeschooling, we enrolled our two older boys in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/perspectives-on-our-childrens-education-a-private-enterprise\/?_gl=1*1jdqgek*_ga*NDM2OTYyMTU2LjE2NTkwMzI0NTA.*_ga_R61P3F5MSN*MTY4MzAyMjgyNi4zNjUuMS4xNjgzMDIyOTE3LjUwLjAuMA..\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private Christian school<\/a> where their youngest brother will join them next year. Lord willing, our boys will continue there through high school. But if our school journey thus far has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we can research and plan, but the Lord establishes our steps (Prov. 16:9).<\/p>\n<h3>What I\u2019ve Learned<\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t know what our school experience will ultimately look like, but here are a few things I\u2019m learning along the way.<\/p>\n<h4>1. School isn&#8217;t a right and wrong decision.<\/h4>\n<p>As we initially considered school options, we felt pressure to make the \u201cright\u201d decision so our kids would be well-educated and prepared for career success while also making sure the Christian worldview we\u2019re trying to instill wouldn\u2019t be corrupted. Not to mention that kids need healthy opportunities for socialization, access to athletics and the arts, and enough technology integration so they can keep up in the modern workforce but not so much screen time that their brains turn to mush. It seemed if we made the \u201cwrong\u201d decision we would disadvantage our kids for life\u2014both earthly and eternal.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, deciding how to educate our children is a responsibility parents should consider carefully. But we need to remember it\u2019s an area of wisdom and conviction, not of right and wrong. As our family has found by trying nearly everything, there\u2019s no perfect school setting\u2014so we can take the pressure off. God is sovereign over our children\u2019s lives, and he\u2019s working all things for their good, no matter where they go to school. We can ask the Lord to give us wisdom and then make a decision. And if our decision is different from another Christian family\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t mean one of us is right and the other is wrong.<\/p>\n<h4>2. School isn&#8217;t necessarily a one-and-done decision.<\/h4>\n<p>Looking back, part of the reason school choice felt so weighty was that I viewed it as a one-time decision. It seemed that once we set our oldest son on an educational path, the course was charted for all of our children for their entire K\u201312 education. Certainly, there can be advantages for children to start in one type of school and have consistency all the way through. But that doesn\u2019t have to be the case. The reason school choice is a choice at all is because we have the blessing of multiple options. And, as our family found, there\u2019s flexibility to reassess and make a different choice as you go.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how much we research and plan for school, there are factors that remain unknown. We might find out one of our children has special learning needs that can\u2019t be accommodated in the school we originally selected. Health struggles for a parent or child might mean homeschooling is no longer feasible. Changes in a school\u2019s leadership or educational philosophy may introduce new concerns. So we make the best decision we can at the time and trust the Lord to provide if we need to make a change later on.<\/p>\n<h4>3. School isn&#8217;t entirely our decision.<\/h4>\n<p>As my husband and I navigated our original school decision, we quickly confronted the reality that school choice isn&#8217;t entirely up to the parents. Our options may be limited by various factors outside our control. We might like to send our kids to public school, but if the ones in our area are physically unsafe or philosophically unsound, that may not be a viable choice. Or we might prefer private school, but if we can&#8217;t afford the tuition or our children aren&#8217;t accepted to the school we want, we&#8217;ll have to choose another option.<\/p>\n<p>Where we live, the needs of our kids, our financial resources, and our own abilities are all limits on our choice. But that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing. God has providentially ordained all of these aspects of our lives, and he may use those very limits to guide our decision-making. If we realize the option we want is not available to us, we can receive it as from the Lord and trust his sovereign care.<\/p>\n<h4>4. School isn&#8217;t a salvation decision.<\/h4>\n<p>As Christian parents, school choice isn\u2019t just about setting our kids up to get into a top-tier college or to be well-rounded in extracurriculars. One of our deepest desires is for our children to love and serve the Lord. So we rightly consider how various environments and influences will either support or challenge the biblical worldview we\u2019re trying to pass on to them.<\/p>\n<p>But if we\u2019re not careful, we can assign too much weight to those influences. Each time we\u2019ve reassessed our school choice, I\u2019ve had to remind myself that where we send our boys to school will not determine where they spend eternity. Christian school will not save our kids. Homeschool will not save our kids. Public school will not separate our children from the love of God. \u201cSalvation belongs to the LORD\u201d (Ps. 3:8), and he chose his people before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). He&#8217;s saving people from every nation, tribe, tongue\u2014and school. Whether our children walk with the Lord is ultimately about his choice, not ours.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Where we send our kids to school will not determine where they spend eternity.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Our oldest son is nearing the end of third grade, and he\u2019s already attended three different types of schools. Very little about our school journey has gone as we planned. Sometimes I look back and wish we\u2019d chosen the Christian school our boys attend now from the start. But if we had, we would have missed the opportunity to experience the Lord\u2019s kindness and provision for our family through all the twists and turns. We\u2019ve learned a lot by navigating school choice\u2014about education, about our kids, and about the Lord who is sovereign over it all.<\/p>\n",

Movie <\/i><\/a>had me smiling with glee because it triggered memories of Nintendo worlds I explored 30-some-odd years ago. And even though <a href=\"https:\/\/tv.apple.com\/us\/movie\/tetris\/umc.cmc.4evmgcam356pzgxs2l7a18d7b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Tetris<\/i><\/a> is less about the Soviet game and more about the fascinating Cold War history behind its origin, it had me itching to return to those childhood hours of Game Boy play on road trips.<\/p>\n<p>These are far from the only films leveraging nostalgia to entice audiences. In the genre of \u201c\u201980s toys turned movies\u201d alone, 2023 has also seen a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/dungeons_and_dragons_honor_among_thieves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons<\/i><\/a> film and will still see the release of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WWWDskI46Js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts<\/i><\/a> on June 9, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DmNDddKcA2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Barbie<\/i><\/a> on July 21, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6VEYgXAJSUY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem<\/i><\/a> on August 4. There are also movies inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/movieweb.com\/live-adaptation-of-hot-wheels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hot Wheels<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/deadline.com\/2022\/03\/play-doh-jon-chu-emily-gordon-movie-1234981605\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Play-Doh<\/a> (yes, Play-Doh) in the works.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the vast majority of blockbusters are reboots, sequels, or franchise films that mine popular intellectual properties for new profits. All of the top 10 highest-grossing movies of 2022 were sequels or reboots. Most analysts expect the 2023 box office will be similarly dominated by superhero sequels or reboots (<i>Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3<\/i>, <i>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse<\/i>,<i> The Flash<\/i>); aging action movie franchise sequels (80-year-old Harrison Ford in <i>Indiana Jones 5<\/i>, 60-year-old Tom Cruise in <i>Mission Impossible 7<\/i>, 68-year-old Denzel Washington in <i>The Equalizer 3<\/i>); Disney reboots (<i>The Little Mermaid<\/i>) and rides-turned-movies (<i>Haunted Mansion<\/i>), and the 10th (10th!) installment in the <i>Fast &amp; Furious <\/i>franchise.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hollywood is a business that responds to markets, and the market has made clear its desire: the old and familiar, not the new and unknown.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s become expected, at this point, for critics to say something like \u201cHollywood is out of new ideas\u201d or \u201cOriginality is dead.\u201d But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. It\u2019s not that creativity is suffering among artists in Hollywood; plenty of highly original stories are being told, in daring and exciting ways. It\u2019s just that Hollywood is a business that responds to markets, and the market has made clear its desire: the old and familiar, not the new and unknown.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than blame audiences for this inclination toward the known and disinclination toward original stories, we should seek to understand why this is the case.<\/p>\n<h3>For Overstimulated Souls, Old Narratives Are Easier<\/h3>\n<p>Why are appetites for \u201cnew\u201d culture waning, while hunger for nostalgia and franchise familiarity is surging? Perhaps it\u2019s because our brains are so overstimulated, so overtaxed in the digital age\u2019s information glut, that we struggle to have the capacity or energy to process anything novel.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of wrapping our minds around a totally new narrative world, with its own \u201crules\u201d and characters and unknown textures, it\u2019s easier to encounter a new entry in an old story; we have existing categories we can file that into, frames of reference that more easily make sense of what we\u2019re seeing. Given that mental energy and available units of attention are increasingly scarce resources (and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org\/hometown-health\/speaking-of-health\/cognitive-overload\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cognitive overload<\/a> is a common struggle), it\u2019s no surprise the majority of moviegoers opt for stories that fall lighter on their brains.<\/p>\n<p>I suspect this is also related to trends of polarization in our culture, in which people cope with the mental exhaustion of the information glut by gravitating toward tribes (and especially tribal leaders) who do the thinking and interpretation for them. I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/narratives-reality\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote about this a few years ago<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">When a relentless barrage of information hits our brains, it\u2019s easier to file things away in tidy narrative boxes (\u201cThis is proof of that\u201d) than to lay them out on a table and see what reality emerges from the evidence. Quickly plugging data into established narratives is a coping mechanism in a world of information overload.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the way people have shifted toward preferring \u201cnarratives\u201d over \u201cnews.\u201d In one of the most prescient works of media analysis in recent years (\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thenewatlantis.com\/publications\/how-stewart-made-tucker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Stewart Made Tucker<\/a>\u201d), Jon Askonas argues that audiences want \u201cnarrative development\u201d from their news media more than objective reporting:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">In the digital age, you really don\u2019t need anyone to read the news to you. What you need is to understand how you should <i>feel<\/i> about it and what story it tells. For most readers, including many in journalism, the details will simply make no difference in their day-to-day lives. Presented with a massive overload of isolated facts, they will simply want to make sense of them. Helping them do that is the most valuable, and most revenue-generating, function of journalism today.<\/p>\n<p>We prefer narrative development over hard news for the same reason we prefer sequels and franchises over original stories. Life in the maelstrom of digital buzz is too overwhelming, and our brains are too stressed, to bother with the expense of energy required to make sense of a complex news headline or a complex new movie narrative.<\/p>\n<h3>DIY Identity Exhaustion<\/h3>\n<p>Another explanation for the growing hunger for nostalgic, familiar pop culture surely has to do with the dizzying, destabilizing effects of the digital age on our identity<b>. <\/b>A few generations ago, the frames of reference for how we understood ourselves were more limited. Our identities largely depended on the unchosen physical and proximate webs we entered at birth: family, place, local culture, religious tradition.<\/p>\n<p>But in the digital age, the tools for identity construction are limitless, unbound by the givenness of unchosen factors that previously defined us (e.g., our biological sex). \u201cWho I am\u201d is now as fluid and malleable a question as I want it to be, subject to the whirling array of arguments, influencers, pseudo-events, and microcommunities that come across my feed from any number of multiverses.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In the digital age, the tools for identity construction are limitless, unbound by the givenness of unchosen factors that previously defined us.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As appealing as this freewheeling identity construction might seem, in practice it\u2019s a source of great emotional stress, spiritual angst, and existential anxiety. To cope with the heavy burden of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crossway.org\/articles\/unpacking-you-do-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a \u201cyou do you\u201d world<\/a>\u2014and the loneliness that results from valuing untethered autonomy over relationships of inconvenient accountability\u2014we crave nostalgia. It reminds us of a time when identity was simpler.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.termsofservice.social\/p\/nostalgia-and-the-digital-man?utm_source=substack&amp;publication_id=49806&amp;post_id=104146778&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;triggerShare=true&amp;isFreemail=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent newsletter<\/a>, Chris Martin shared a Marshall McLuhan quote from a 1977 television interview that speaks to this dynamic: \u201cOne of the big marks of the loss of identity is nostalgia. And so revivals in every phase of life today\u2014revivals of clothing, of dances, of music, of shows, of everything\u2014we live by the revival. It tells us who we are, or were.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Martin goes on to ponder whether \u201cthe light speed with which we consume content and information today has, in a sense, left us longing for the simplicity of the past. When we knew who we were.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s right that we long for the \u201csimplicity\u201d of the past in a digital world that presents us with horrors, contradictions, fake news, and inflammatory narratives of every sort on a constant feed. But the identity-longing we feel\u2014of which nostalgia is a sort of \u201csignal of transcendence,\u201d to quote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Signals-Transcendence-Listening-Promptings-Life\/dp\/1514004399\/\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Os Guinness\u2019s fantastic new book<\/a>\u2014also has a lot to do with longing for the sort of community of shared culture we once had.<\/p>\n<h3>Longing for Community<\/h3>\n<p>Part of why we hunger for the latest Disney princess reboot, the latest Marvel or DC entry, or further movies about the treasured toys of our childhoods is that they invite us into existing traditions and established communities, in ways that make us feel less lonely. They invite us into conversations where there\u2019s already a shared vocabulary and ongoing interpretive tradition.<\/p>\n<p>I have a buddy who grew up, like I did, in the pop culture of the \u201980s and \u201990s. He and I have a lot of overlap in our movie tastes. Yet we rarely talk about the latest new indie movie I\u2019ve seen or the buzzworthy Netflix series he recently watched. When we talk pop culture, it\u2019s because we\u2019re lamenting how bad the latest <em>Jurassic Park<\/em> movie was compared to the majestic 1993 original (which we saw when we were 10-year-old boys). We assess the latest entries in the <em>Star Wars<\/em> universe or ponder what\u2019s next for Quentin Tarantino or Paul Thomas Anderson. In other words, we connect on shared history and shared pop culture language.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Our hunger for familiar franchises and nostalgic sequels has a lot to do with our longing for a community in which we can better understand our world and ourselves.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is a big purpose culture serves: community and connection. And in a world of increasingly solitary media consumption, our hunger for familiar franchises and nostalgic sequels has a lot to do with our longing for a community in which we can better understand our world and ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, constructing bespoke identities around hyperspecific personal tastes and eclectic curation of pop culture is lonely and unsatisfying. We long for culture that <i>connects<\/i> rather than isolates. And right now, the culture that does this most readily is heavy on nostalgia and familiar franchises.<\/p>\n<h3>Takeaway for the Church<\/h3>\n<p>While the critic in me wants to lament the situation I\u2019ve described above\u2014in which original storytelling is disincentivized by the market\u2019s hunger for franchise familiarity\u2014the church leader in me finds reason to hope.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because what we\u2019re seeing in pop culture is a longing for <i>established narrative worlds<\/i> and <i>existing communities of interpretation<\/i>, because the digital world is too overwhelming to navigate alone or from scratch. This sounds like a need the church was designed to fill.<\/p>\n<p>Is there any established narrative world and shared discursive vocabulary more ubiquitous than the biblical narrative and Christian interpretive tradition? Are there any cultural liturgies of fandom or consumerism more satisfying or shaping than the communities of worship that gather to praise the living God and unpack his living Word? In a rootless world of self-made identity, the church offers a constant invitation for nomad-consumers to find their place in a stable, welcoming, committed community with a shared narrative that has proven compelling and transformative for billions across the world for 2,000 years.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, the lonely and rootless sojourners of a post-Christian digital world are flocking en masse, as if on pilgrimage, to the sacred spaces of nostalgia and the comfort food of pop culture \u201cuniverses.\u201d The church shouldn\u2019t see itself as an \u201calternative\u201d to Mario or Barbie movies in satisfying these longings, as if a Sunday worship service is on par with a Nintendo product or Mattel toy. But we can recognize that when these pop culture nostalgia trips fail to address the longings of this lonely, meaning-hungry generation, the church will still be there\u2014doors open wide, ready to point people to the Savior more real than any superhero and a narrative more true and powerful than any mere entertainment.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">What just happened?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear a case, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/docket\/docketfiles\/html\/public\/22-451.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo<\/em><\/a>, that could significantly scale back the authority and power of federal agencies. The case has the potential to overturn or restrict the legal standard known as \u201cChevron deference,\u201d which has had wide-ranging effects on administrative law\u2014and could have important implications for religious liberty.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">What is \u2018Chevron deference\u2019?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Chevron deference is a legal doctrine that affects legal interpretations, particularly in the realm of administrative law. The doctrine was created by the Supreme Court in the 1984 case <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/1983\/82-1005\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Chevron doctrine consists of a two-step analysis. The court must first determine whether the statute (a written law passed by Congress) in question is clear and unambiguous. If the statute&#8217;s meaning is clear, the court must apply the law as written and the agency&#8217;s interpretation is irrelevant. However, if the court finds the statute to be ambiguous, it must then determine whether the agency&#8217;s interpretation of the statute is reasonable. If the agency&#8217;s interpretation is deemed reasonable, the court must defer to that interpretation, even if the court might have reached a different conclusion.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">What was the \u2018Chevron\u2019\u00a0case about?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Clean Air Act, which regulates air pollution at the national level, includes a requirement that states establish a permit program regulating \u201cnew or modified major stationary sources\u201d of air pollution. The Carter administration defined \u201cstationary source\u201d as any device in a manufacturing plant that produced pollution. But after Ronald Reagan was elected in 1981, his EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)\u2014which was headed at the time by Justice Gorsuch\u2019s mother, Anne M. Gorsuch\u2014said that \u201csource\u201d meant the entire plant.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Natural Resources Defense Council challenged that redefinition in federal court and won. The company Chevron, which was affected, appealed and the case went to the Supreme Court. The Court ruled in 1984 that when Congress passed a law that didn&#8217;t have a clear meaning, the courts should defer to reasonable interpretations by the federal agency applying the law. The Court said, \u201cThe EPA\u2019s interpretation of the statute here represents a reasonable accommodation of manifestly competing interests, and is entitled to deference.\u201d This standard has since been referred to as Chevron deference.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">What are the arguments for and against Chevron deference?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some of the arguments made in favor of Chevron deference include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Appeal to expertise:<\/strong> The world is complicated, which complicates the application of regulations. Federal administrative agencies are presumably staffed with experts who possess specialized knowledge in their respective fields and therefore are in a better position to know how to interpret and apply regulations. In contrast, most courts often lack the same level of expertise necessary to make adequate interpretations. Chevron deference presumably acknowledges this reality and allows agencies to fill in the gaps left by Congress in a way that&#8217;s consistent with their expertise.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Flexibility:<\/strong> Chevron deference provides federal agencies with the flexibility to adapt their interpretations and regulations as conditions within society change. This flexibility allows them to respond to new scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and evolving social norms more effectively than if the courts were to interpret the statutes without deference.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Political accountability:<\/strong> Administrative agencies are part of the executive branch and are therefore more directly accountable to the president, who is in turn accountable to the electorate, than are federal judges. Chevron deference recognizes that agencies, as part of the political process, are better suited to make policy choices than unelected judges.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Consistency and predictability:<\/strong> By deferring to agency interpretations, courts can promote consistency in the application of federal regulations. This helps create a more predictable legal environment, which is beneficial for individuals, businesses, and other stakeholders.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some of the arguments made against Chevron deference include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Separation of powers:<\/strong> Critics argue that Chevron deference undermines the separation of powers by allowing the executive branch to encroach on the judiciary&#8217;s role in interpreting the law. Under the Constitution, the role of interpreting statutes falls to the courts. By deferring to agencies, courts may inadvertently be abdicating their responsibility to ensure laws are interpreted and applied according to the Constitution and legislative intent.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Concentration of power:<\/strong> Chevron deference effectively concentrates legislative, executive, and judicial power within administrative agencies. This concentration of power has often led to a lack of checks and balances, making agencies less accountable for their actions. Critics argue agencies have exploited Chevron deference to expand their authority, leading to bureaucratic overreach and abuses of power.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Giving power to unelected bureaucrats:<\/strong> A central concern is that Chevron deference has empowered unelected bureaucrats to make policy decisions that should be reserved for Congress or the courts. As part of the executive branch, federal agencies are subject to political pressures that influence their decision making. By deferring to agencies, courts could allow unelected officials to shape policy without direct accountability to the electorate.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Arbitrary decision making:<\/strong> Another concern raised by critics is that Chevron deference has lead to arbitrary decision making by federal agencies, as their interpretations change with each new administration. This lack of stability has created uncertainty for individuals, businesses, and other stakeholders affected by these regulations. Courts may be better positioned to provide a more stable and neutral interpretation of the law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why should Christians care about Chevron deference?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whether persuaded by the arguments for or against this legal doctrine, Christians should be aware of how Chevron deference can lead to negative outcomes for religious people, particularly when federal agencies interpret and enforce statutes involving religious practices or beliefs. By deferring to agencies&#8217; interpretations, courts might uphold regulatory actions that undermine religious freedom.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, the Affordable Care Act required most employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraception at no additional cost to their employees. While the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) created some exemptions and accommodations for religious employers, the HHS&#8217;s interpretations were subject to Chevron deference. This deference led courts to uphold the agency&#8217;s interpretation, even though the mandate and its accommodations still infringed upon the beliefs of religious employers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another example is the control federal agencies can have over religious employers, such as churches and religious schools. For instance, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is responsible for interpreting and enforcing Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based on religion. Chevron deference can affect religious liberty when the EEOC interprets the statute in a way that limits a religious organization\u2019s ability to make employment decisions consistent with their religious beliefs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Such threats, whether in the past or in the future, are a primary justification for asking the Supreme Court to carefully examine the implications of Chevron deference on religious liberty and other fundamental rights.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>I know pastors\u2019 kids\u2014of all ages\u2014who are doing well. Kids who love Christ and obey his Word. Kids who serve the church and who seek God&#8217;s glory.<\/p>\n<p>I know other pastors\u2019 kids\u2014of all ages\u2014who aren\u2019t doing well. Kids who can\u2019t be bothered to examine their own hearts or to get up for church on a Sunday morning. Kids who resent God\u2019s commands regarding sexuality or his call for us to suffer. Kids who want to be loved by the world and who want nothing to do with the love of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>Simply being the child of a church leader is no guarantee of spiritual health\u2014and parents know this all too well. So where can we go for help?<\/p>\n<h3>Children Were Brought to Jesus<\/h3>\n<p>The familiar story in Matthew 19 provides hope and encouragement for ministry families who are raising children:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Then children were brought to [Jesus] that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, but Jesus said, \u201cLet the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\u201d And he laid his hands on them and went away. (Matt. 19:13\u201315)<\/p>\n<p>Parents who brought their children to Jesus had no illusions about their children\u2019s well-being. They recognized that their kids had needs beyond their human ability to meet. By faith, they knew that Jesus was their kids\u2019 only recourse. The parents in this story were probably not serene and smiling, as they often appear in children\u2019s Bibles; like us, the parents in this story were desperate.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The parents were probably not serene and smiling, as they often appear in children\u2019s Bibles; like us, the parents in this story were desperate.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And so they overcame every obstacle to bring their children to Jesus and plead for his help. They packed up children and supplies; they traveled dusty and dangerous roads; they refused to take the disciples\u2019 no for an answer. Like the men who clawed a hole in the roof for their paralyzed friend (see Mark 2:1\u201312), and the mother who willingly compared herself to a dog to beg for relief for her demon-possessed daughter (see Matt. 15:21\u201328), and the woman who elbowed through the crush of people to tug at Jesus\u2019s robe for healing from her decade-long affliction (see Matt. 9:20\u201322), these parents wanted Jesus\u2019s mercy\u2014and they wouldn&#8217;t be dissuaded.<\/p>\n<p>And as he did for so many others who sincerely sought healing and salvation, Jesus responded to them with love. He welcomed the children, testified to their eternal value, prayed for them, and invited them to belong to his kingdom.<\/p>\n<h3>Let the Children Come<\/h3>\n<p>We bring our children to the same Jesus today. As we urge them to worship, pray for them, speak God\u2019s Word to them, and press them to trust him for salvation, we present them to the only Savior of sinners and look for him to work in their hearts.<\/p>\n<p>We do this by our example. We do this by our discipline. We do this in family worship and at mealtime prayer. We do this by bringing our children under the Word in corporate worship. We do this in faith.<\/p>\n<p>Like the parents in today\u2019s passage, we face obstacles to our task. Our kids\u2019 rebellious attitudes, spiritual disinterest, or lethargy regarding the means of grace often make it hard. But Matthew 19 assures us Jesus loves to hear and answer the prayers of desperate parents.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p class=\"gmail_default\">Many of us experience a form of social anxiety. We&#8217;re about to arrive at a social event and we find ourselves having second thoughts. We wonder if we&#8217;re really wanted or whether the host is just going through the motions inviting us over. We fear there may be awkwardness or that we might not gel as well with our hosts as we thought.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gmail_default\">Many of those fears can be put to rest with the right kind of welcome. If the door is opened and we&#8217;re immediately made to feel valued, we know we&#8217;re wanted, among friends, and safe. The relief can be palpable. If we&#8217;re the host, this is exactly how we want our guests to feel. We want our homes to be places people feel dignified and desired, welcomed and wanted.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gmail_default\">The same should be true of our churches. We want them to be easy places for people to come the first time, or on their own, or with heads full of doubts, or with unconfessed guilt. That instinct is biblical. Paul writes, &#8220;Welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you&#8221; (Rom. 15:7).<\/p>\n<h3>New Gospel Ground Rules<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s think about those opening moments of a church service. They couldn\u2019t be more important. They\u2019re the storefront window of Christ\u2019s welcome for people who often walk into church feeling like outsiders.<\/p>\n<p>In Romans, Paul didn\u2019t write, \u201cWelcome one another like people at the fitness club down the road do.\u201d We\u2019re not conveying <em>our<\/em> welcome but <em>Christ\u2019s<\/em> welcome. It\u2019s not about exchanging a cultural pleasantry but declaring a heavenly reality. We\u2019re meant to invite brokenhearted sinners to collapse into Jesus\u2019s open arms.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We want our homes to be places people feel dignified and desired, welcomed and wanted. The same should be true of our churches.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The start of our gathered worship is possibly the most precious moment in the whole service. We have only a minute to make it a <em>gospel<\/em> moment. With God\u2019s help, we want to rearrange people\u2019s spiritual reality right from the get-go. They might be thinking,<\/p>\n<p><em>I don\u2019t know why I came this week. This isn\u2019t for me.<br \/>\nI\u2019m just no good at Christianity. No one here gets me.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>How long will I be stuck here? <\/em><\/p>\n<p>We want to lead them to instead think,<\/p>\n<p><em>You mean Jesus is really like this? I\u2019m so relieved I came.<br \/>\nI so need this. Maybe there is hope for me.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>I can\u2019t wait to come back next Sunday. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of the welcome at the start of the service and how much is lost when it isn&#8217;t handled carefully, pastorally, and with gospel intentionality.<\/p>\n<p>The opening moments of our services are when we can establish new gospel ground rules for why and how we gather as Christians. We\u2019re not here to do God a favor, to give him some company for an hour or so, to make him feel better. We\u2019re not here to pay a weekly religion tax so he gets off our back for the next six days. We\u2019re not here to get our respectability card stamped for another week. We\u2019re here for just one reason: Christ has welcomed us. We need to wrap our brains around that good news.<\/p>\n<h3>Gospel Welcome from the Start<\/h3>\n<p>Some might think we don\u2019t necessarily need to make the gospel <em>the<\/em> issue at the welcome when there are songs, prayers, sacraments, and a sermon that will declare the gospel. Surely we can trust the rest of the service to bring home the reality of grace.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s an urgent reason why the welcome is consequential: How could we bear making anyone wait before experiencing the welcome of Jesus? It isn\u2019t a formality. His gracious welcome is the whole point.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve found over the years that it can sometimes take most of the service for people to get to where they start to believe God truly loves them. Perhaps by the end of the sermon. Perhaps in time to enjoy the final song. But what if, with God\u2019s help, we usher the people into this gospel glory right at the start? What if, instead of them slowly warming up over the course of an hour or so, they start out experiencing Christ\u2019s welcome? Then, for the rest of the service, they can bask in it.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m writing this amid a European heat wave, while on vacation in a musty old building that\u2019s never heard of air conditioning. My only way to cope has been to periodically slip into the pool to cool myself down. Refreshing, cool water on a hot, sticky body is utterly blissful. I often linger there, marveling at how good it feels.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what a church refreshed with gospel welcome feels like to exhausted sinners. They aren\u2019t standing by the side of the pool, being told how cool it is, and only after a while getting in. From the first moment of the service, they\u2019re welcomed in. The pastor gently, sincerely declares Jesus\u2019s refreshing grace. And he washes it over the people\u2019s weary souls from the outset.<\/p>\n<h3>Welcome to the Savior<\/h3>\n<p>This is an area where I\u2019ve changed as a pastor. I used to think I was welcoming people to church. Romans 15:7 has made me realize I\u2019m welcoming people to <em>Christ<\/em>. I\u2019m not trying to break the cultural ice; I\u2019m aiming for spiritual renewal right then and there. I\u2019m longing for the welcome of Jesus to be a felt reality from the opening seconds.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>How could we bear making anyone wait before experiencing the welcome of Jesus?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There are many ways to provide such a gospel welcome. Each church will rightly have its own traditions, personality, denominational responsibilities, and so on. This isn\u2019t about being a little more Baptist here or Anglican there. It\u2019s about establishing clearly, from the first moment the pastor steps up in front of the congregation, that this isn\u2019t like any other gathering around the city. Our meeting doesn\u2019t revolve around a shared interest, common cause, or cultural expectation. We\u2019re in church because Jesus\u2019s heart-melting welcome has pulled us in. Where else would we be?<\/p>\n<p>The pastoral welcome isn&#8217;t the only time and place where we want the welcome of Jesus to be unmissable, of course. After all, Paul\u2019s command to \u201cwelcome one another as Christ has welcomed you\u201d applies to more than the pastor and more than a church service. But wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if our pastoral welcome Sunday by Sunday became the jump-start for our week-long intention to make the welcome of Jesus less theoretical and more personal? Having received the welcome of Christ in church, it becomes a lot easier to share the welcome of Christ all week long.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring is here, the time when many churches are preparing for short-term missions trips. A staggering <a href=\"https:\/\/missionguide.global\/articles\/mission-trip-research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2 million or more<\/a> Americans go on these trips each year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a field worker for the last 20 years, I believe there are two key elements for such a trip to be successful. First, your team needs to meet regularly. Second, you should seek to serve the partner missionaries&#8217; strategic needs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With those priorities in mind, here are some basic tips for before, during, and after the trip.<\/p>\n<h3>Before You Go<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first question to ask is this: Where does your trip originate? Was it your idea, your church\u2019s, or your partner missionaries\u2019? There are many decisions to make: when you&#8217;ll go, what you&#8217;ll do, and how many people will participate. But this preliminary question will make all the difference.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s best not to do anything until you talk with your partner missionaries. Ask them how a trip could help their strategy. Be aware that missionaries often think they\u2019re expected to provide satisfactory trip opportunities for churches or else they\u2019ll lose the partnership. You need to assure them this isn&#8217;t the case. Instead, take their lead.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully the missionaries know their needs and how your team can strategically help. Align your expectations to those needs. For example, ask the missionaries how many people should come. Most likely they\u2019ll prefer a smaller team, which is often more manageable and effective.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about how you can prepare your team to fulfill the missionaries&#8217; strategy. How can they be spiritually ready? Can you provide opportunities to pray together about the trip? Should you provide theological, evangelistic, or skills training? How much of the language and culture can you teach them about before they go? Can you provide some cross-cultural experiences before they leave home? Most churches that do short-term trips well provide at least four pretrip meetings to equip the team.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Most churches that do short term trips well provide at least four pretrip meetings to equip the team.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>While You\u2019re There<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you\u2019re on the field, keep your team meetings going. I love seeing teams who debrief daily so they know what is and isn\u2019t going well. More importantly, this is a tremendous discipleship opportunity. Involve the missionaries in these times to teach cross-cultural skills. Your team will learn skills they can apply in their lives back home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, be sure to follow the missionaries&#8217; lead throughout the trip. They know the place and the people. They know potentially dangerous situations and what to do in a crisis. Listening to them and doing what they say is usually the best way forward during the trip.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reciprocate for all the missionaries do for you, the team should go ready to serve. Missionaries often labor in difficult circumstances year-round. Are there ways you could help them during your stay? Consider offering to watch their kids one night so they can go on a date. Perhaps take their whole family to a fun place\u2014and pay for it. The best teams that came while my family was overseas loved our children well, and our kids loved them in return. Plus, it gave our children the opportunity to be cultural guides and translators. It\u2019s a win-win.<\/p>\n<h3>After You Return<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019re home\u2014you guessed it\u2014keep meeting. Continue to debrief. This can be done individually or as a group. Either way, talk about what they\u2019ve learned and how they can apply it. God may be leading some of them to consider long-term missions.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The best teams that came while my family was overseas loved our children well, and our kids loved them in return.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Celebrate the trip with your church, whether by creating a short video, having the team visit small groups, or inviting them to share their experience at an event. This will do wonders in creating missions awareness in your church.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a way for trip participants to continue serving in your church or community at a deeper level. Don\u2019t let the only next step be taking them on another short-term trip. Instead, help team members connect the dots of how to apply their missions experience to where they live.<\/p>\n<h3>Packing Tips<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps I can best sum this up with a few packing tips. Work hard to see that your team packs things like humility, listening skills, a learning mindset, a servant attitude, and plenty of flexibility. Take care that they don\u2019t pack pride, rigidity, or the need to be right, comfortable, and in control.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They may bring back some great \u201csouvenirs,\u201d like a more mature worldview, a practical understanding of how to live on mission here at home, and a heart for all nations. That\u2019s a week well spent.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "3 Reasons to Sing the Apostles\u2019 Creed"
    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Why should we say or sing the creeds in public worship? Surely creeds are something you keep in your back pocket\u2014just in case. They\u2019re a kind of yardstick to ensure our churches and their leaders stay on track.<\/p>\n<p>But if that\u2019s it, why not keep them in a drawer until they\u2019re needed? Everyone recognizes you need a set of rules to play football, but fans don\u2019t chant those rules in the stands. So why sing the creeds? Here are three reasons.<\/p>\n<h4>1. The creeds celebrate the gospel.<\/h4>\n<p>The Apostles\u2019 Creed, for example, is in the form of a story. It begins with God and creation. It moves to the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus as well as looking forward to his return. And it tells the story of the Spirit\u2019s involvement in our lives now\u2014speaking through the Bible, gathering the church, reassuring guilty hearts, and filling us with hope.<\/p>\n<p>To say or sing the Apostles\u2019 Creed is to retell the story of salvation. Yes, creeds refute error, but they do so by declaring the glories of the gospel story.<\/p>\n<h4>2. The creeds unite us to the worldwide church.<\/h4>\n<p>Of course, many of the songs we sing in church tell the gospel story. But the creeds do so as a <em>shared affirmation<\/em>. It\u2019s not just me, or even my congregation, who believe this. This is the faith of the church throughout the ages and across the world. The Apostles\u2019 Creed is perhaps the earliest creed we have outside the New Testament. Here are truths both ancient and always fresh. They\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/new-city-catechism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hundreds of years old, yet as relevant as ever<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Creeds refute error, but they do so by declaring the glories of the gospel story.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We\u2019re part of a chain that spans the pages of history. We received these truths from those who proclaimed them to us, and the people who proclaimed them to us received them from previous generations. This should humble us, for it reminds us the gospel didn\u2019t start with us.<\/p>\n<p>Reciting the creeds also reminds us we, too, are links in this chain. \u201cWhat you heard from me,\u201d says Paul in 2 Timothy 1:13\u201314 (NIV), \u201ckeep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you\u2014guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A few verses later, he adds, \u201cThe things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others\u201d (2 Tim. 2:2, NIV). It\u2019s our responsibility to guard these truths and pass them on to future generations. And that challenges us. We shouldn&#8217;t let the gospel stop with us.<\/p>\n<h4>3. The creeds are subversive.<\/h4>\n<p>By declaring these convictions, we\u2019re disavowing the ideologies of our culture. We\u2019re saying, \u201cThe triune God proclaimed in the creed is <em>our<\/em> God, and we will not worship the gods of this age.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We say this to the world as an act of defiance. But we also declare this allegiance to our own hearts. That\u2019s one purpose of worship: to call one another not only to the worship of God but also <em>away<\/em> from the worship of the destructive ideologies of the world and its empty priorities.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>By declaring these convictions, we\u2019re disavowing the ideologies of our culture.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So in the Apostles\u2019 Creed, every \u201cI believe in God\u201d implies a corresponding rejection of false gods. And every \u201cI believe in God\u201d is laying a firm foundation for the ups and downs of life.<\/p>\n<p>In the face of materialism, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crcna.org\/welcome\/beliefs\/creeds\/apostles-creed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we declare<\/a>, \u201cI believe in God, the Father almighty\u201d. To those who claim we\u2019re self-made, we declare, \u201cI believe in God . . . creator of heaven and earth.\u201d When pluralists claim all religions are essentially the same, we declare, \u201cI believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son.\u201d Amid the moral relativism of our culture, we declare, \u201cI believe . . . he will come to judge the living and the dead.\u201d When the church seems powerless, we declare, \u201cI believe in the Holy Spirit.\u201d When guilt threatens to overwhelm our souls, we declare, \u201cI believe in . . . the forgiveness of sins\u201d. And when death comes knocking at our doors, we declare, \u201cI believe in . . . the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Sing of Victory<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re like people singing their national anthem during a time of occupation, confident liberation is coming because we believe \u201cJesus Christ . . . who will come again to judge the living and the dead.\u201d In this sense, a creed is also a victory shout. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HVyUiqvbmBw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">song I cowrote<\/a> with Emu Music (watch below) sets the Apostles&#8217; Creed to music, helping your congregation to proclaim the victory of the gospel.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s take the ancient creeds out of the drawer, dust them down, and let them be heard in our congregations\u2014said, sung, and celebrated as shared affirmations of the gospel story.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><iframe title=\"Apostles&#039; Creed \/\/ Emu Music\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/HVyUiqvbmBw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Do you think of biblical or Christian counseling mainly as something to pursue when you\u2019re in a personal crisis? Do you think of it primarily as designed to help with emotional, mental health, or relational struggles? While those can all be benefits, counseling can also be an unexpected resource for discipleship and for strengthening your faith.<\/p>\n<p>Our faith can be tested by many everyday questions and challenges. Believers wisely seek answers to their doubts and questions about God in prayer, Bible reading, and their church communities. But God can also use counseling to strengthen you in the following four ways.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Counseling can provide deeper understanding.<\/h4>\n<p>When you meet with a biblical or Christian counselor, you open an avenue for gaining a deeper understanding of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and of how they affect your relationship with God. A trained counselor can help you identify patterns of thinking and behaviors that may be contributing to your faith struggles. She assists with making the necessary connections between your personal history, current struggles, and God\u2019s Word.<\/p>\n<p>As a counselor, I\u2019ve found exploring biblical examples of other believers (psalmists, prophets, apostles, and Christians) who struggled with their faith honestly before the Lord to be helpful for those wrestling with weak faith. By considering your unique struggles, a counselor can help you engage with God more personally.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Counseling can provide a safe place to express doubts and questions.<\/h4>\n<p>Every Christian has doubts, but knowing who to talk to about our doubts can be tricky. Some find it difficult to talk to others in their church or small group for fear they\u2019ll dismiss the doubts or jump to conclusions. You may feel shame just for having doubts. Church leaders can especially struggle because others see having confidence in God as part of their job description.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A trained counselor can help you identify patterns of thinking and behaviors that may be contributing to your faith struggles.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Finding a safe, confidential place where you can vocalize doubts and wrestle with questions without judgment is a first step toward getting through seasons of doubt. When you talk with a counselor who is anchored in the truth of Scripture, he can help you confidently pour out your heart to God (Ps. 62:8) and gain the courage to share your struggles or honestly confess your failings with others without fear (James 5:16).<\/p>\n<h4>3. Counseling can teach us how God uses others to increase faith.<\/h4>\n<p>Struggling with doubts can lead to isolation. When you see others who appear to be thriving, you feel alone. But Christianity is a faith built on community, connection, and bearing one another\u2019s burdens (Gal. 6:2). God can use counseling to allow you to experience the patience and encouragement of another person during seasons of doubt (1 Thess. 5:14). In turn, you\u2019re better equipped to understand others and offer support in similar ways.<\/p>\n<p>The spiritual support you receive in counseling reminds you God is at work amid your days of doubt. God can use this to increase your faith and strengthen bonds of community and belonging. You were never meant to live life alone. You need others, and others need you.<\/p>\n<h4>4. Counseling can promote a fresh vision for the gospel.<\/h4>\n<p>Exploring your questions about God\u2019s plan for your life with a faithful, believing counselor can be a means to anchor your heart to God\u2019s good news. As you grasp God\u2019s redeeming work through Jesus and gain confidence in the Spirit\u2019s transforming power, you\u2019ll want others to experience it as well (Acts 1:8). Through the gospel, God offers us grace for our doubts and his Son, our Savior, for our troubled world (John 16:33). This compels you to share the good news of Jesus with others who are searching for answers and lasting hope.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Exploring your questions about God\u2019s plan for your life with a faithful, believing counselor can be a means to anchor your heart to God\u2019s good news.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>James writes, \u201cCount it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials\u202fof various kinds,\u202ffor you know that\u202fthe testing of your faith\u202fproduces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be\u202fperfect and complete, lacking in nothing\u201d (1:2\u20134)<\/p>\n<p>Life is full of challenges, and it can be difficult to find the strength and resilience we need to overcome them when our faith is faltering. But counseling is a valuable resource and a pathway to joy in seasons when your faith is weak.<\/p>\n<p>When you engage in counseling that\u2019s rooted in biblical truth, not only is your faith strengthened but you become better equipped to serve God and love others who may also be struggling with their faith.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve never been a fan of big Christian conferences. I&#8217;d prefer just to watch the content afterward. For me, conferences mean crowds of people, frenzied activity, lots of strangers, and a flood of information I&#8217;ll never remember. When I lived in the United States, I never made it to The Gospel Coalition National Conference because, well, I\u2019d rather read the website!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how does someone like me become the founder and a council member of TGC Norden? Because of our big God.<\/p>\n<h3>Preparing the Way<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/norden.thegospelcoalition.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TGC Norden<\/a> seeks to serve Christians in the countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, as well as the Faroe Islands and Greenland. My name is Carl Jan Christian Roth, and the story of TGC Norden\u2019s beginnings is much like a biblical story\u2014one of God preparing the way, of his power made perfect in weakness (2 Cor. 12.9). In his first letter to the Corinthian church, Paul admitted he\u2019d come to them not with eloquent speech or \u201cplausible words of wisdom\u201d but in a demonstration of the Spirit\u2019s power (1 Cor. 2:1\u20134). As our brother Tim Savage clarifies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Power-through-Weakness-Understanding-Corinthians\/dp\/0521496403\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in his book<\/a> on gospel ministry from 2 Corinthians, Paul wanted to distance himself from the self-exalting sophists of Corinth and simultaneously dismantle the criticism he was receiving from the church by providing this paradox: \u201cWhen I am weak, then I am strong\u201d (2 Cor. 12:10).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first showed up in Copenhagen with my wife, Stephanie, we felt our weakness profoundly. I was an Americanized Swede lost in Denmark. A friend of mine who\u2019d worked as an evangelist for decades in Denmark told me my vision of seeing 10 churches planted in 10 years was a pipe dream. There had been three or four other Acts 29 church plants in the area that had wonderful support from an established and encouraging congregation, but they\u2019d eventually sputtered out and stagnated. Meanwhile, my very articulate (in English) wife struggled to learn Danish, sounding like a toddler to our friends. Then came COVID lockdowns and a new baby for our family. But God was preparing the way.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I was an Americanized Swede lost in Denmark.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, I heard a story about a group of churches starting a TGC chapter in southeast Europe. I reached out to a friend of a friend and finally connected with J. D. Gilmore, who was helping in this effort. He tasked me with surveying pastors around the Nordics about what value they might see in a similar coalition. The response was more positive than I expected\u2014alongside some heated dialogue. A few months later, I met Tim Savage. God had recently called Tim to move to England, and he\u2019s now helping oversee the development of European branches of TGC. The timing couldn&#8217;t have been better.<\/p>\n<h3>Gospel Fellowship<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim started joining our meetings. He turned out to be just the encouragement we all needed while nearly all churches in Denmark were locked down and many church planters were struggling to know how to meet people. \u201cPreach the gospel of a big God,\u201d he told us. \u201cLook for what God is doing, who <em>he<\/em> is raising up. This begins with faithful pastors meeting together and locking arms in gospel fellowship.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Many of us who preach the Word and stay centered on the gospel in the Nordics can feel like we\u2019re the only ones doing it. (Sometimes, it\u2019s like you\u2019re the only one in your whole country, as a brother in Iceland shared with me.) In countries like Sweden, being a complementarian feels like something you have to keep in the closet. The dominant national churches of Norway, Denmark, and Finland also seem to water down Christianity in our culture. In the Faroe Islands, it can feel as if Christians are watching the Nordics moving further and further down the path of the secular creed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the big God of Scripture isn\u2019t finished with the Nordics.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The big God of Scripture isn\u2019t finished with the Nordics<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve already hosted a conference in Copenhagen with Tim Savage, Collin Hansen, and Mark Dever, with over 150 total leaders and pastors (online and in person) joining hands and hearts in worship. We\u2019ve formed a council and met in Oslo to pray and dream together. And we\u2019re eager for more resourcing, more preaching, and more laboring together for the gospel across national boundaries and even across denominations. We who preach the Word in each of these traditions have more similarities than differences, because our hearts beat for the same gospel, the same theological vision for ministry, and the same doctrines of grace.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m thankful my first TGC conference was a small one, gathering 100 or so pastors in Copenhagen. Though we were small in number, the shared worship and vision for reaching the West with the gospel were sweet. I have to admit, although I still feel a bit shy with the crowds and the loud music, the TGC conference experience is growing on me.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Imagine watching the final play of a football game from several different camera angles.<\/p>\n<p>Angle one from the pylon cam: a player scores a rushing touchdown.<\/p>\n<p>Angle two from behind the goalposts: he scores the touchdown and spikes the ball.<\/p>\n<p>Angle three from the blimp: he scores a touchdown, spikes the ball, and the crowd rushes the field and fills the stadium.<\/p>\n<p>Our understanding of this one event grows in intensity and meaning as it\u2019s shown from multiple angles. In his classes at Reformed Theological Seminary, Michael Kruger uses this helpful metaphor to explain a biblical literary device called <i>recapitulation<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>Recapitulation is the act or instance of summarizing and restating a narrative to give a different emphasis or perspective. One biblical book that employs recapitulation with stunning effect is Revelation.<\/p>\n<h3>Seeing the World Through 7s<\/h3>\n<p>Revelation is notoriously confusing, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Yes, there are dragons, angels, antichrists, and (seemingly) multiple returns of Christ. But if we read this book through the lens of recapitulation, it becomes easier to understand.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s widely agreed that Revelation is structured by the repetition of sevens\u2014seven churches, trumpets, bowls, and so on. But questions arise about the sequence and scope of the successive sevens. How do they hold together? When do they occur? How far does each one extend? Recapitulation helps us answer these questions.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Revelation isn\u2019t meant to be read merely as a chronology of fantastic events. It should be seen as one set of events repeated seven times, each with increasing intensity.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Revelation isn\u2019t meant to be read merely as a chronology of fantastic events. It should be seen as one set of events repeated seven times, each with increasing intensity. Revelation is apocalyptic\u2014a genre defined by images, symbols, and references to the Old Testament and John\u2019s ancient world. It\u2019s intended to help the churches to whom it&#8217;s written see the world in a different way.<\/p>\n<p>As Richard Bauckham <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Theology-Book-Revelation-New-Testament\/dp\/0521356911\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes<\/a>, \u201cThe effect of John\u2019s visions . . . is to expand his readers\u2019 world, both spatially (into heaven) and temporally (into the eschatological future).\u201d This accords with other ancient Jewish apocalyptic literature (like Daniel and some extracanonical books), but unlike extrabiblical literature, Revelation remains distinctly Christian and Christ-focused.<\/p>\n<h3>What Do the 7 Sections Depict?<\/h3>\n<p>The seven sections depict the two advents (or arrivals) of Jesus and the time between them. In different ways, they each tell the same story of Jesus returning to save and judge. Read this way, we see John\u2019s clear and repeated emphasis on the final judgment, and we see the one event of Jesus\u2019s return in its all-encompassing beauty.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Revelation 1:1\u20133:22<\/h4>\n<p>From the beginning of the book, the number seven holds symbolic weight. Bauckham argues that the seven spirits before the throne (1:4) symbolize the Holy Spirit in the fullness of his power and presence to the churches. Moreover, Jesus addresses seven churches. These churches represent all churches that will exist in the inter-advent period, or the period between Jesus\u2019s first and second comings.<\/p>\n<p>We know this because in Jewish apocalyptic literature, the number seven represents perfection or wholeness. It\u2019s no coincidence there are seven churches, lamp stands, seals, scrolls, and days of creation; seven-times sprinkling at the altar; and seven years of jubilee. As G. K. Beale <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Revelation-Commentary-G-K-Beale\/dp\/0802866212\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">notes<\/a>, \u201cSeven in the OT and Revelation figuratively refers to completeness and fullness.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>2. Revelation 4:1\u20137:17<\/h4>\n<p>The second section features the scroll, the seven seals, and the 144,000. The scroll represents God\u2019s plan for the inter-advent period.<\/p>\n<p>The seven seals represent the trials placed on earth during the inter-advent period, culminating in God\u2019s judgment. As the seventh seal is opened, we see our first angle of Jesus\u2019s return.<\/p>\n<p>The 144,000\u201412,000 from each tribe multiplied by 12\u2014shows the fullness of God\u2019s people in Israel and the church (12 tribes and 12 disciples). The focus isn\u2019t on numerical precision but on a group so large that no one can number them, from every tribe, nation, and tongue.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Revelation 8:1\u201311:19<\/h4>\n<p>The seven trumpets are blown. John transitions to a different angle of the inter-advent period, with a pattern that holds the same across each series as the individual trumpets are blown. As Beale states, \u201cToward the end of each series, there\u2019s a description of judgment followed by a depiction of salvation.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The focus isn\u2019t on numerical precision but on a group so large that no one can number them, from every tribe, nation, and tongue.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The trumpets usher in God\u2019s judgment in seven areas of creation\u2014the earth, sea, rivers, heavens (sun, moon, and stars), pit of the abyss, river Euphrates, and lightning and hail. In chapter 11, we also see Jesus\u2019s return from a second angle increasing in intensity as the 24 elders worship God. The final judgment leads to a rewarding of saints small and great. The words here for the final judgment are used again in 20:12, clueing Revelation\u2019s reader into the reality that the judgments of Revelation 11 and 20 are the same event viewed from different angles.<\/p>\n<h4>4. Revelation 12:1\u201314:20<\/h4>\n<p>This section features the second coming again, as the great dragon, Satan, persecutes the church. If this event is meant to follow chapter 11, the chronology would be confusing. It\u2019s better to see this section as another recapitulation, and the intensity increases as John uses the imagery of a bloody winepress for God\u2019s great harvest judgment.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Revelation 15:1\u201316:21<\/h4>\n<p>In this fifth section, John describes the seven bowls that represent God\u2019s wrath poured out. They climax in the great battle of Armageddon.<\/p>\n<p>In 16:17, the voice from the throne says, \u201cIt is done!\u201d If read chronologically, it would be difficult to understand the finality, but this is another camera-angle vision of the end.<\/p>\n<h4>6. Revelation 17:1\u201319:21<\/h4>\n<p>Recapitulation is especially clear here. As J. D. Shaw <a href=\"https:\/\/gracebibleofoxford.com\/messages\/the-revelation-of-jesus-christ\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">points out<\/a>, rather than seeing the events in succession, the vision returns to chapter 12. All the characters on Revelation\u2019s world stage begin to fall. Babylon, the beast, the false prophet, and (as we\u2019ll see in chapter 20) the Devil himself are cast into the lake of fire. The only two characters left on the stage are the woman and the child. This is the great battle and the marriage of the church to the Lamb.<\/p>\n<h4>7. Revelation 20:1\u201322:21<\/h4>\n<p>The battle again! <span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">This final vision <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">highlights the triumph of Christ and the ultimate victory of God&#8217;s redemptive plan. It includes the binding of the great dragon (20:1\u20133), which shows Christ&#8217;s victory over evil. Satan is restrained and unable to deceive the nations or hinder the advance of the gospel for a thousand years.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> Lastly, the new heavens and new earth are revealed. God dwells with his people, and there&#8217;ll be no more sin, suffering, or death.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Throughout the book, when John uses phrases like \u201cafter this\u201d or \u201cafter these things,\u201d he\u2019s not denoting the historical chronology of the events he describes. Rather, he\u2019s chronicling the order in which he saw a series of visions. The different angles display God\u2019s judgment and ultimate triumph in Jesus Christ\u2014the one great event of his return.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>There\u2019s an awareness month for everything these days. May alone is devoted to skin cancer awareness, teen self-esteem awareness, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awarenessdays.com\/awareness-days-calendar\/zombie-awareness-month-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zombie awareness<\/a>, among other causes.<\/p>\n<p>May is also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.childwelfare.gov\/fostercaremonth\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foster Care Month<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We know from Scripture that caring for vulnerable children and their families is precious in God&#8217;s sight. We serve a God who \u201cupholds the widow and the fatherless\u201d (Ps. 146:9), and it&#8217;s the church\u2019s responsibility to \u201cgo, and do likewise\u201d (Luke 10:37). God has so identified himself with the plight of vulnerable children and single moms that he won&#8217;t receive worship from those who fail to bring justice and plead on their behalf (Isaiah 1:11\u201317). Jesus\u2019s own brother said it this way: \u201cReligion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world\u201d (James 1:27).<\/p>\n<p>Supporting foster care is a beautiful way Christians can advocate for the fatherless, and May is an opportunity to heed God\u2019s invitation to plead for and bring justice to those in the foster care system. Here are five ways your church can offer \u201cpure and undefiled worship\u201d by engaging this cause.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Highlight Foster Care Month.<\/h4>\n<p>Church leaders shouldn&#8217;t be captive to highlighting every awareness month or #hashtag campaign, but you can use May to help your people honor God by caring for children and youth in foster care. Here are a few ideas to get you started.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Show a <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/8n8k5G85ve4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video<\/a> that highlights the realities of families experiencing foster care.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Invite a trusted <a href=\"https:\/\/cafo.org\/members\/?country=usa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foster care organization<\/a> to come share at your church.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Interview a fostering family at your church and ask them why they&#8217;re foster parents.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2. Honor foster parents in your church.<\/h4>\n<p>Foster families are on the front lines of demonstrating God\u2019s tender care for the fatherless. They&#8217;re a beautiful example of God\u2019s command to \u201ckeep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice\u201d (Gen. 18:19). Unfortunately, their work often goes unnoticed within the church. Foster Care Month is a great time to honor their commitment to this work of Christlike compassion, mercy, and justice. Consider these ideas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Invite them up to honor them with a gift like flowers or a gift card to a good restaurant.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Celebrate Mother&#8217;s Day by acknowledging the emotional sacrifice of a foster mom who pours herself out for children who&#8217;ll one day move on to new families.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Pray publicly for foster families as they do the hard work of helping to restore broken families back to health.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more ideas on supporting foster and adoptive parents, listen to Tony Merida, Rosaria Butterfield, and Dennae Pierre on the <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/podcasts\/tgc-podcast\/can-encourage-adoptive-parents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TGC Podcast<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Research foster care needs in your area.<\/h4>\n<p>Be aware of your community\u2019s specific needs. Before churches cast a vision and recruit people to serve in foster care, they need to first ask good questions. Often, well-intentioned Christians sign up to serve in areas where there isn\u2019t a need. Some families start the process of becoming foster parents, hoping to be placed with a newborn baby or a toddler under the age of 2. While this desire is commendable, in some counties in the U.S. there&#8217;s little need for more foster families who aren&#8217;t willing to take older children.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Be aware of your community\u2019s specific needs. Often, well-intentioned Christians sign up to serve in areas where there isn\u2019t a need.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In my experience, social workers often have negative experiences of Christians wanting to foster, because many of them aren&#8217;t open to sibling sets or children over the age of 5. I once asked the social worker who oversees foster care placements for all of Orange County, California, how the church could help. Her exact words were \u201cPlease don\u2019t send me any more Christians who only want healthy babies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s do the work of being informed so we can truly be a blessing to those we serve. Here are a few steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Research <a href=\"https:\/\/datacenter.kidscount.org\/data#USA\/2\/0\/char\/0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foster care statistics for your area<\/a> to know the greatest needs.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Contact your county&#8217;s children and family services department and ask how the church can help. Meet the needs they have.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Connect with a local foster family agency or bridge organization. Many of these organizations have programs specifically designed to empower faith communities and engage local churches.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4. Drip feed, don&#8217;t downpour.<\/h4>\n<p>When churches address foster care, they tend to only talk about it once a year (possibly only during the awareness month). Yet most people need to hear about the need for foster parents multiple times before they&#8217;ll consider action. Here are some natural ways to keep the vision before your church:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Appoint a local champion or foster care advocate at your church.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Mention the practical work of foster care in your sermon when the text engages the plight of orphans and widows.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Read Jason Johnson\u2019s short and immensely helpful book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Everyone-Can-Something-Strategically-Vulnerable\/dp\/1625861796\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Everyone Can Do Something<\/i><\/a> to get practical ideas on how your church can make a difference in foster care.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5. Connect foster care to the gospel.<\/h4>\n<p>There are ample ways to do this, but here are a few to get you started:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Jesus loved us at great expense to himself so we would have new life under his care. Foster care is willingly carrying the pain of traumatized children so they&#8217;ll find new life under your care.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Jesus freely welcomed us into his family when we needed a home. Foster care is sharing your home with children who need a safe place to live.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Jesus not only reconciled us to the Father but restored our relationships with one another. Foster care is working to restore a broken family to health.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>May the Spirit of Christ grant you and your church the courage, grace, and vision to join our good Father in upholding the widow and the fatherless.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>In the 19th century, theological liberalism undermined European and American confidence in the truthfulness and authority of Scripture. Amid that crisis, the theologians of Princeton turned to the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646). Men like A. A. Hodge and B. B. Warfield retrieved and reasserted Westminster\u2019s doctrine of Scripture. That recovery informed a century of Protestant pastors and perhaps even foreshadowed and assisted the work of the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy at the end of the 20th century.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the Confession bears lasting fruit. Its doctrine of God, which reflects classical Christian theism and the mature fruit of post-Reformation theology\u2019s articulation of the being and works of the triune God is enjoying a renaissance in our time. It has provided protection from sub-biblical and ill-informed conceptions of God.<\/p>\n<p>As Sinclair Ferguson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Westminster-Confession-21st-Century-Vol\/dp\/1857929926\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes<\/a>, \u201cTo an extraordinary degree [the Westminster Divines] studied in depth the same issues which trouble and challenge the church today, and their work continues to serve as an invaluable guide.\u201d It\u2019s well worth our time to acquaint ourselves with the Confession and its history, content, and influence.<\/p>\n<h3>History and Content<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcaac.org\/bco\/westminster-confession\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)<\/a>, along with the Larger and Shorter Catechims, stands at the end of the Reformed tradition\u2019s confessional age. It builds on over a hundred years of Protestant theological reflection and formulation in Europe, while also incorporating the rich legacy of historic creedal Christianity stretching back to the early church councils and fathers.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Confession has provided protection from sub-biblical and ill-informed conceptions of God.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Confession of Faith derives its name from the Westminster Assembly (1643\u201349\/52), which met in London\u2019s historic Westminster Abbey. The Assembly was an ecclesiastical council appointed by \u201cthe Long Parliament\u201d of 1640\u201348 to recommend reforms in the doctrine and practice of the Church of England.<\/p>\n<p>We can sum up the Westminster Confession\u2019s 33 chapters in two parts, not unlike some of Paul\u2019s epistles: doctrine (chapters 1\u201318, 32\u201333) and duty (19\u201331). The confession summarizes for us what the Scriptures teach us to believe (the theology of the faith) and how we&#8217;re to live (a practical Christian ethic).<\/p>\n<p>The Confession contains 186 paragraphs and at least 205 distinct theological propositions, but it can be broadly outlined in eight sections: Scripture (chapter 1), God (2\u20135), man and sin (6), Christ and salvation (7\u201313), our God-enabled response to God\u2019s salvation (14\u201318), the Christian life (personal, familial, and social, 19\u201324), the Christian life (ecclesiastical, 25\u201331), and last things (32\u201333).<\/p>\n<p>The Westminster Catechisms, too, follow this outline. The Shorter Catechism could be summed up as what Christians believe (Questions 1\u201338) and how Christians are to live (39\u2013107). The Larger Catechism\u2019s structure is similar, with sections dedicated to doctrine (Questions 1\u201390) and duty (91\u2013196).<\/p>\n<h3>High Doctrine of Scripture<\/h3>\n<p>The Confession begins by making the case for the necessity of Scripture, God\u2019s written special revelation and inscripturated self-disclosure. The first chapter goes on to state the contents of Scripture positively (what books are in the Bible) and negatively (what books are not). Then it shows in consecutive sections why we believe the Bible is authoritative, true, sufficient for salvation and Christian living, clear, immediately God-breathed, providentially preserved\u2014even while it must be translated into common languages.<\/p>\n<p>The chapter concludes with a fundamental principle of biblical interpretation\u2014Scripture infallibly interprets Scripture\u2014and the powerful assertion that the Bible is the sole final authority in all matters of theological dispute. It&#8217;s the <em>norma normans non normata<\/em> (the norm that norms and cannot be normed). That is, because Scripture is the Word of God, it has the final word in all matters of faith and practice.<\/p>\n<p>This chapter\u2019s 1,000 words on the doctrine of Scripture, and the density and detail of the argument, make evident how important the Scriptures are for the Divines. B. B. Warfield <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Works-Benjamin-B-Warfield-Westminster\/dp\/B000O2W8O0\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cited<\/a> A. F. Mitchell, a 19th-century historian of the Assembly:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">If any chapter . . . was framed with more elaborate care than another, it was that which treats \u2018Of the Holy Scripture.\u2019 It was considered paragraph by paragraph\u2014almost clause by clause\u2014by the House of Commons as well as by the Assembly of Divines, before it was finally passed.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Creeds-Christendom-Volumes-Philip-Schaff\/dp\/0801082323\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Philip Schaff<\/a> also considered the Confession\u2019s teaching on Scripture to be the definitive Protestant counterpart to Roman Catholic teaching on the subject: \u201cNo other Protestant symbol has such a clear, judicious, concise, and exhaustive statement of this fundamental article of Protestantism.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Pastoral Concern<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t read the Confession carefully and miss its pastoral attention. This isn\u2019t surprising given that the 16th-century Puritans in England and Presbyterians in Scotland represented a movement that has bequeathed to us a tradition of pastoral theology unsurpassed in English-speaking Christian history.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Confession begins by making the case for the necessity of Scripture, God\u2019s written special revelation and inscripturated self-disclosure.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the Confession\u2019s chapter on God\u2019s eternal decree, which deals with the Reformed doctrines of God\u2019s sovereignty, predestination, and preterition, the Divines are concerned these doctrines be taught in such a way that what&#8217;s often a matter of theological disagreement will produce \u201chumility, diligence, and abundant consolation to all that sincerely obey the gospel\u201d (WCF 3.8). In passages like this, the Confession frequently and directly connects theology to practice. It shows what truth is meant to produce in Christians&#8217; lives.<\/p>\n<p>Another example is the chapter \u201cOf Assurance of Grace and Salvation.\u201d Often, Christians are unsettled by their doubts, troubled by ongoing struggles with sin, and unsure of their salvation. The Confession, however, gives beautiful, biblical, and realistic comfort:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Yet are they never utterly destitute of that seed of God, and life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart, and conscience of duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may, in due time, be revived; and by the which, in the meantime, they are supported from utter despair. (WCF 18.4)<\/p>\n<p>Only a doctrinal statement written by pastor-theologians who are true and experienced doctors of the human heart could contain such pastoral wisdom and precision. This sort of care for souls is evident throughout the confession.<\/p>\n<h3>Global and Multidenominational Influence<\/h3>\n<p>The Divines aimed to bring about unity between all the Protestant churches of England, Scotland, and Ireland. They failed in that aspiration, but they couldn\u2019t have imagined their influence on global Christianity today.<\/p>\n<p>Their theological formulations inform and encourage more than 70 million Christians in numerous denominations worldwide. There are more Korean Christians in churches that subscribe to the Confession than there are Britons and Americans. There&#8217;s a growing Reformed movement in India, China, and Southeast Asia. There are more Brazilians and Mexicans in denominations that acknowledge the Confession than in the U.S. and Canada, and Africans outnumber them all.<\/p>\n<p>The Confession has also influenced multiple Protestant church traditions. Many associate the Confession with Presbyterianism, but Westminster has shaped the theology of Congregational, Baptist, and Anglican churches through confessions they\u2019ve adapted. There has always been a stream of Anglicanism with high regard for the Confession, and the late J. I. Packer, an evangelical Anglican, did as much as anyone to popularize it in the larger evangelical world.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Only a doctrinal statement written by pastor-theologians who are true and experienced doctors of the human heart could contain such pastoral wisdom and precision.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Movements and organizations like Ligonier Ministries, the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, Together for the Gospel, The Gospel Coalition, the World Reformed Fellowship, the International Conference of Reformed Churches, and the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council have helped spread awareness and reception of the theology of the Confession worldwide. Seminaries with multidenominational constituencies and global reach have also helped broadcast awareness and foster the embrace of the Confession\u2019s theology around the world and into numerous church bodies.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sense in which we&#8217;re living right now in a golden age of availability of published works on the Confession, the Assembly, and its theologians. The recent rediscovery and publication (in 2012) of <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Minutes-Papers-Westminster-Assembly-1643-1653\/dp\/019920683X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Minutes and Papers of the Westminster Assembly (1643\u20131652)<\/a><\/em> by Chad Van Dixhoorn and his subsequent research are significant parts of this.<\/p>\n<h3>Enduring Fruit<\/h3>\n<p>When I\u2019m asked by seminary students to define Reformed theology, I often describe it as a school of historic, orthodox, confessional, Protestant Christianity in which the sovereignty of God, the authority of Scripture, God\u2019s grace in salvation, the necessity and significance of the church, and covenant theology are maintained and emphasized. All these are special emphases of the Westminster Confession, and the Confession has proved persuasive of these doctrines in the church at large today.<\/p>\n<p>What has been called the \u201cReformed awakening\u201d or the \u201cReformed resurgence\u201d of the last 50 years, or even what people designate as \u201cBig God Theology,\u201d gives evidence of the widespread influence of the Confession\u2019s teaching on God\u2019s sovereignty and grace.<\/p>\n<p>No wonder the Westminster Assembly\u2019s Confession of Faith and Catechisms have been called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Confessing-Faith-Readers-Westminster-Confession\/dp\/1848714041\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the finest and most enduring statements of early modern Reformed theology<\/a>,\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Religious-History-American-People\/dp\/0300100124\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">by far the most influential doctrinal symbol in American Protestant history<\/a>.\u201d The influence of the Confession shows no sign of slowing down in our time.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>David Livingstone (1813\u201373) is known as a missionary, explorer, and abolitionist. He was the first missionary to bring the gospel to my beloved country, Malawi, in 1859. He also explored routes that would open Africa for trade with the rest of the world. Inspired by a British member of Parliament, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, Livingstone was committed to abolishing the Arab and Swahili slave trade and bringing \u201cthree Cs\u201d to Africa: Christianity, commerce, and civilization.<\/p>\n<p>A lot could be said about the man, but on this day\u2014the 150th anniversary of his death\u2014I want to reflect on his work as a missionary.<\/p>\n<p>Livingstone was born on March 19, 1813, in Blantyre, Scotland. He grew up Presbyterian in the Church of Scotland until he became a Congregationalist at age 15. Coming from a poor background, he worked hard in a cotton factory to save money for medical school. After completing his medical studies at Anderson\u2019s University in Glasgow, he joined the London Missionary Society with the intention of going to China as a medical missionary. But the Opium Wars of 1839\u201342 and a persuasive interaction with another renowned British missionary, Robert Moffat, changed Livingstone&#8217;s plans and sent him to Africa instead.<\/p>\n<h3>Into Parts Unknown with the Gospel<\/h3>\n<p>On March 14, 1841, Livingstone arrived in Cape Town, South Africa. Not long after, he was mauled by a lion, injuring his left arm. Although the arm healed, it troubled him for the rest of his life.<\/p>\n<p>As he received treatment for his arm, he met his wife, Mary, daughter of Robert Moffat. They married in 1845. <span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">In 1852, Livingstone sent his family to London as he continued preaching, establishing mission stations, and exploring southern Africa, only briefly returning to Britain in 1856. This is a dark stain in Livingstone&#8217;s story: sadly, his great missionary labors were at the expense of his family.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>On September 17, 1859, he arrived in Malawi. And he brought the gospel with him.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In 1858, he returned to Africa with the focus of exploring routes on the Zambezi River to enhance trade between Britain and Africa. The challenge of navigating the river, however, turned Livingstone&#8217;s interests to the Shire River and Lake Nyasa (now Lake Malawi) instead. On September 17, 1859, he arrived in Malawi. And he brought the gospel with him. I&#8217;ve visited a tree in Cape Maclear under which he used to sit and study Scripture in preparation for his evangelism efforts among the Yao people of Malawi.<\/p>\n<h3>Home Is Where the Heart Is (Literally)<\/h3>\n<p>In 1861, the Universities\u2019 Mission to Central Africa\u2014an Anglican mission agency\u2014sent a team of missionaries to Malawi to establish the first mission station in Magomero, Chiradzulu. Livingstone\u2019s wife, Mary, returned in 1862 to join him but died shortly thereafter in Shupanga, Mozambique. He returned to Britain for the second time in 1864.<\/p>\n<p>In 1865, Livingstone came back to Africa for the last time. By April 1873 he was increasingly ill with malaria and other infections. On May 1, 1873\u2014150 years ago today\u2014<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Livingstone entered the glory of his Master. He died at Chitambo village in Zambia. Oral tradition says he was found in a kneeling position by his bed, as if in prayer. The tradition also says the British asked for his remains to be expatriated to England, but the Africans insisted he was to be buried in Africa\u2014where his heart was. After going back and forth, the groups compromised: the Africans buried his heart in Chitambo and the British buried his body in Westminster Abbey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Lasting Influence<\/h3>\n<p>Livingstone remains a favorite of many in southern Africa, particularly in Malawi. The commercial capital, Blantyre, is named after his birthplace. I&#8217;m delighted and humbled to labor as a pastor in this city. The history of the church in Malawi cannot be written without mentioning Livingstone. The British government ended the Arab slave trade because of his efforts. He championed the dignity of Africans because they&#8217;re created in God\u2019s image just like every human being.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The history of the church in Malawi cannot be written without mentioning Livingstone.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Above all, Livingstone\u2019s life is a great demonstration of Jesus\u2019s parable of the mustard seed in Mark 4:30\u201332. Surely he didn&#8217;t know how much the seed sown in southern and central Africa would grow. I doubt he ever envisioned his labors would influence the entire nation of Malawi. In one journal entry, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.au\/books\/edition\/The_Personal_Life_of_David_Livingstone\/f84NAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Livingstone wrote<\/a>, \u201cI will place no value on anything I have or may possess, except in relation to the kingdom of Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By God&#8217;s grace, the kingdom is no longer a tiny mustard seed in Africa. It has grown and put out large branches all across the continent. Praise God for his faithful servant.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>In the age of social media, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/canceled-understanding-eastern-honor-shame\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cancel culture<\/a> has become a societal norm. For better or worse, the power to complain, speak directly to power, or question what\u2019s happening behind the scenes is in the hands of everyone with a smartphone.<\/p>\n<p>On one hand, social media has given a voice to those who once lacked it. On the other hand, our posts can blaze a never-ending warpath for those seeking vigilante justice. But what if a more deep-rooted, human need lies beneath the surface of cancel culture? What if cancel culture isn&#8217;t only a social issue but also a gospel opportunity?<\/p>\n<p>When we hear about the latest person being canceled, we often either roll our eyes and move on or make a snap judgment and choose a side. Instead, here&#8217;s how we can think it through\u2014and perhaps talk it through with others\u2014in light of the gospel.<\/p>\n<h3>How Did We Get Here?<\/h3>\n<p>Many of us may wonder how cancel culture began. In short, this phenomenon is an undercurrent of the pluralist and postmodern waters we swim in every day. To explain, let\u2019s wade into a little philosophy. But don\u2019t worry; we won\u2019t get too deep.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Hiebert <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Missiological-Implications-Epistemological-Shifts-Postmodern\/dp\/1563382598\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">identifies<\/a> two kinds of postmodern worldviews:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i>Skeptical postmoderns<\/i> reject moral, objective truth and lean toward nihilism\u2014the belief that life is meaningless. And that belief breeds despair.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i>Affirmative postmoderns<\/i> are more idealistic. They believe humanity will improve through access to tools like science, education, and social justice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Younger millennials and Gen Z lean toward affirmative postmodernism and care a great deal about justice. Without a moral authority, like Scripture, to guide them, they must construct and implement their own understanding of justice\u2014which is incredibly difficult in our complex world. Cancel culture simplifies this process by making things black and white. Suddenly, one&#8217;s conscience or social circle serves as judge, jury, and executioner on moral matters.<\/p>\n<h3>Nothing New Under the Sun<\/h3>\n<p>Though the term &#8220;postmodernism&#8221; has only existed since the 1950s, post-truth logic is nothing new. The same conflict of justice and truth plagued Pontius Pilate in the Gospels.<\/p>\n<p>In his role as judge, Pilate resisted the Jews who accused Jesus because he felt Jesus was innocent. Pilate later questioned Jesus himself, begging Jesus to give him a reason to release him. In the end, the conflicted Pilate bemoaned, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d (John 18:38).<\/p>\n<p>Pilate couldn\u2019t find Jesus guilty, but he also didn\u2019t have a solid foundation for truth\u2014even though it was staring him in the face. Because of his difficult political position, Pilate washed his hands of responsibility and deferred to public opinion to crucify Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>As people made in God&#8217;s image, culture warriors hunger and thirst for righteousness. But as broken people in a fallen world, they might not know how to find it. So they deal with the problem the only way they know how: by canceling what seems wrong in their own eyes.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>As people made in God&#8217;s image, culture warriors hunger and thirst for righteousness. But as broken people in a fallen world, they might not know how to find it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Instead of lashing out or flippantly dismissing cancel culture, we should meet accusations (from the right and the left) with compassion and unfailing gospel truth. If done well, these conversations display the beauty of the gospel\u2014where justice and mercy meet.<\/p>\n<h3>What Cancel Culture Gets Right<\/h3>\n<p>Like most cultural elements, cancel culture does get some things right. Throughout Scripture, we\u2019re reminded that injustice and evil should be uncovered and eliminated. Though we may not affirm its methods, cancel culture points to the truth of human depravity and the prevalence of injustice in our world.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of immediately dismissing the accusations of cancel culture, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/podcasts\/tgc-podcast\/how-gentleness-raises-us-above-cancel-culture\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christians should listen carefully<\/a>. Because our justification is secure in Christ, we can listen to accusations knowing we\u2019re not condemned by our true Judge. If wrongs exist and need to be righted, we should want to know. Where sin exists in our lives or communities, we should mourn, confess, repent, and rebuke as necessary. Christians, of all people, should be well practiced in repentance. God doesn&#8217;t turn a blind eye to evil, nor should we.<\/p>\n<h3>What Cancel Culture Misses<\/h3>\n<p>But cancel culture also misses the mark, particularly by offering only bad news. As the margin of error gets smaller and smaller, even one poorly worded comment online can condemn the most righteous among us. Eventually, everyone who falls under the microscope of cancel culture fails.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Christians, of all people, should be well practiced in repentance.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Cancel culture offers condemnation with no hope for redemption. Like the law, it reveals our brokenness but offers no solution. We\u2019re left to slowly cancel everyone in an effort to assert our own righteousness\u2014to prove we&#8217;re just enough, conscientious enough, woke enough, or conservative enough to call out others. This raises the question, Is anyone worthy? And here in the confusion, the light of the gospel shines most brilliantly.<\/p>\n<h3>Justice and Mercy Meet in Christ<\/h3>\n<p>The only solution to the brokenness around us and in us is Christ. The cross is proof that God hasn&#8217;t given up on mankind\u2014though he rightly could. At the cross, God\u2019s righteous anger is satisfied. And his loving-kindness provides a way forward for the condemned.<\/p>\n<p>God proves himself to be who he says he is\u2014\u201cmerciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but . . . by no means [clearing] the guilty&#8221; (Ex. 34:6\u20137).<\/p>\n<p>In his kingdom, God is righting wrongs and making all things new. So we can be honest about the depth of our sin and proclaim with hope the depth of God&#8217;s grace.<\/p>\n<p>Only these redemptive truths can satisfy people\u2019s desire for justice, so let\u2019s communicate them clearly. Instead of waving away the claims of cancel culture, let\u2019s use it as an opportunity to share the gospel. Let\u2019s point out how the desires behind cancel culture are only satisfied in Christ. There&#8217;s good news for cancel culture after all.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Charlie was a quiet man who loved God and people. Even in his late 60s, he worked to provide for his family and served faithfully as a deacon at church. When Charlie\u2019s mom got sick and there was no one to take care of her, he moved into her place to help her with toileting, showering, and dressing\u2014all the things she\u2019d done for him when he was a child. Charlie fulfilled a godly duty to his mother, but because she lived far away, this meant sacrificing time with his wife.<\/p>\n<p>When Charlie began to care for his mom, his wife became difficult and overly dependent, seemingly needing constant attention. She was embittered toward Charlie and his ailing mother. Charlie confessed to his friend Levi how hard it was to endure this criticism when his mother clearly needed help. His wife wasn\u2019t working or helping him care for his mom. Charlie also confessed he preferred time at his mother\u2019s home. After all, she was kind and appreciative, and his wife wasn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Levi asked him, \u201cWhat will you do after your mother passes?\u201d He expected Charlie to say he wouldn\u2019t go back home to his difficult wife. Charlie\u2019s actual response was astounding: \u201cI made a commitment to my wife before God and his people. I won\u2019t leave her. I love her. That promise holds me.\u201d If you\u2019re enduring a difficult marriage, rehearsing that covenant promise can hold you too.<\/p>\n<h3>Sacrificial Covenant<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 1em;\">There are times\u2014amid infidelity, abandonment, or abuse\u2014for a married couple to separate (Matt. 5:32; 19:9; 1 Cor. 7:15). But too often in our culture, a marriage has simply become a contract of convenience that can be discarded. Biblically speaking, covenants should be different. Biblical covenants are a binding agreement with blessings when kept and curses when broken (Deut. 28). Throughout the Bible, <\/span>God relates to his people through covenants, and we&#8217;re told marriage ultimately serves as an illustration of Christ\u2019s covenant love for the church.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I made a commitment to my wife before God and his people. I won\u2019t leave her. I love her. That promise holds me.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As newlyweds begin their life together, they celebrate joy and the beginning of a new family. They also make binding covenant promises because married life is never easy. It demands our life and all. Husbands must love their wives as Christ loved the church (Eph. 5:25\u201330).<\/p>\n<p>Marriage doesn\u2019t exist so a man and woman can pretend like they\u2019re a power couple. Marriage exists so <em>sacrifice<\/em> may be put on full display. Whether or not you said the old vows&#8217; words\u2014\u201clove and cherish\u201d through \u201crich or poor, in sickness and in health\u201d\u2014your marriage still requires that encompassing commitment. You must die to self through the work of the Spirit (Rom. 8:13).<\/p>\n<h3>Demanding Covenant<\/h3>\n<p>No matter how good you think your marriage is, you and your spouse are still sinners, and you need to rehearse your vows. You need the words of law and gospel inherent in the covenant commitment you made.<\/p>\n<p>Look at what the law of Ephesians 5 demands. Wives, submit (v. 22). Husbands, love (v. 25). We\u2019re told to do this because our sinful desires run contrary to God\u2019s covenant love. We want what we want, and when we don\u2019t get it, we get cranky. So God tells us what to do. Wives are told to submit to their husbands as Christ lovingly submitted to the Father, his covenant head in his work of redemption (1 Cor. 11:3). Husbands must speak and show love to their wives in ways that put Christ\u2019s love for his church on display (Eph. 5:25\u201333).<\/p>\n<p>Husbands, serve your wife with your words. Ensure your words to your wife reflect God\u2019s words. Speak with gracious words to \u201cwash her\u201d (v. 26) and aid her holiness. Speak with words that encourage her. Jackie and I have a son with autism, and when days are long and hard, it&#8217;s important for me both to take my share of caretaking responsibilities and to encourage her with the truth that the final resurrection is coming and the brokenness will end.<\/p>\n<p>Wives, help your husband both by listening to him and by speaking bolding. On those dark days when he\u2019s not communicating well but you know he\u2019s hurting, look for the nonverbal cues that let you know he needs you. On my dark days (or just when I&#8217;m not getting what I want), Jackie&#8217;s quick to remind me to turn from my anger and to turn toward Christ&#8217;s love. When I&#8217;m doubting, she reminds me of the gospel truths that I&#8217;ve spoken to her and preached to our church: &#8220;You&#8217;re raised with Christ and that&#8217;s enough.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Couples, know that God\u2019s demands for marriage aren&#8217;t ultimately about you or your spouse. They\u2019re about Christ and his church. We\u2019re caught up in something so much bigger than we are, and these spiritual realities ground the practical, daily work of marriage. Do you simply want to learn how to \u201cput up with\u201d your spouse, or do you recognize that marriage is more? Ask instead, \u201cHow can I display God\u2019s love by loving my spouse?\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Gracious Covenant<\/h3>\n<p>How do we obey these impossible commands? We cling to the gospel. Charlie, in his simple yet profound way, understood the meaning of covenant. He understood grace is one-way love grounded in Someone greater than us. Because of Jesus&#8217;s death for us, Christians understand that he holds us fast. He&#8217;ll never leave nor forsake us (Heb. 13:5), but we still need to rehearse the story of Christ\u2019s love on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>No matter how good you think your marriage is, you and your spouse are still sinners. You need the words of law and gospel inherent in the covenant commitment you made.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the same way, spouses should regularly rehearse and renew their marriage vows with one another. Don\u2019t wait until your relationship is at emergency level to \u201cwork on\u201d your marriage. When you feel your relationship is in a good place, remember God\u2019s goodness and rehearse your promises. Like a strong tree, absorb the sunshine so you can stand through the storm.<\/p>\n<p>Find God\u2019s grace in the church as well. At a wedding, couples make their vows publicly because they\u2019re held accountable by God\u2019s people. Accountability from the church should continue throughout the marriage. Look for models in your church who have strong marriages centered on Christ. Look for people who have suffered well and connect with them. Let them love and support you. Seek out godly mentors who can speak hard truths into your life and arrange regular meeting times with them. Be vulnerable to trusted Christians and let them care for your marriage.<\/p>\n<p>God&#8217;s steadfast, covenant love fuels us when we&#8217;re depleted, and rehearsing both his covenant promises (and our own) can help to uphold and strengthen any marriage, no matter the challenges that arise.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last three days were supposed to be a cease-fire in Sudan, where two factions are fighting for control of the military and government. While the fighting\u2014gunshots, explosions, and fighter jets\u2014never did <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/gunfire-explosions-are-heard-in-sudans-capital-despite-cease-fire-d79f957d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cease<\/a>, thousands saw this week as their opportunity to evacuate from Khartoum, the country\u2019s capital and the center of the conflict.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They\u2019re fleeing a rapidly deteriorating situation. Khartoum\u2019s morgues are full, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-65373644\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dead bodies lie in the streets<\/a>, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2023\/04\/27\/1172123699\/sudan-conflict-explained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">healthcare system is collapsing<\/a>. Electricity and running water are often unavailable, food is growing scarce, and the internet is unstable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the refugees is a small band of Christians. There weren&#8217;t many to begin with. Sudan is mostly Muslim; Operation World <a href=\"https:\/\/operationworld.org\/locations\/sudan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimates<\/a> just 2.5 percent of the population are evangelical Christians. On top of that, Sudan\u2019s ethnic and religious persecution was so severe that in 2011, the majority-Christian South Sudan broke away to form their own country.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That didn\u2019t make things safer for Christians left in Sudan. Christian women and girls are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opendoorsuk.org\/persecution\/world-watch-list\/sudan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in danger<\/a> of rape and forced marriage. Christian men and boys have been beaten and imprisoned. In 2023, Sudan ranked in the World Watch List\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opendoorsus.org\/en-US\/persecution\/countries\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top 10<\/a> hardest places in the world to be a Christian.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until this week, most of them lived in Khartoum.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like others, they\u2019re on the run. A few days ago, one pastor led a group about 120 miles southwest to the city of Madani, said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjuzaS3o8r-AhXnlIkEHfMsBVkQFnoECAgQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fafrica.thegospelcoalition.org%2Fprofile%2Fdavid-fugoyo%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw06SZmgtrRPWdfVmUN-rcgr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Fugoyo Baime<\/a>, a <span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Council member<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> of The Gospel Coalition Africa and vice president for programs and development at <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alarm-inc.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">African Leadership and Reconciliation Ministries<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe pastor said the conditions are not good,\u201d Fugoyo told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t have even mattresses to sleep on, and they are running out of food. There are many of them and not enough money. The situation is not good.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fugoyo lives and works in Uganda but was born in Sudan (now South Sudan) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/preparing-to-rebuild-the-worlds-youngest-and-deadliest-country\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">grew up<\/a> in Khartoum. He was there a few weeks ago to encourage and teach church leaders. I asked him what was going on, how it was affecting Christians, and what he told Christian refugees this week. (The following has been adapted for readability.)<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>What is going on in Sudan? Is there a side Christians can support?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not really. After the ouster of President al-Bashir in 2019, the commander of the army took over control of the government. He also still controlled the army. But he didn&#8217;t control the separate paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. These forces, established by al-Bashir in 2014, are empowered, wealthy, and well-armed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan is for the military government to transition over to a civilian government. As part of that process, the army and RSF are supposed to merge into one force. But the two leaders disagree on the process and length of time it should take\u2014the army said a few months, the RSF said 10 years. The disagreement escalated to what we&#8217;re seeing today. The two armies are now fighting, and each leader wants the other to surrender and be arrested.<\/p>\n<h4>How is this affecting the few Christians in Sudan?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After South Sudan won its independence from Sudan, Christians in Sudan suffered. Pastors were arrested. Other Christians were denied their basic rights as citizens. Church properties were closed or taken by people linked to that [government] system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, they are just trying to survive the fighting.<\/p>\n<h4>You spoke to some of these Christians yesterday. What did you tell them?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I told them two things.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, I reminded them of what I told them a few weeks ago when I was with them in Khartoum. I met with around 80 Christians, and I talked about how to be a good leader and the importance of discipleship. More importantly, I talked about why God allows hardships. I told them that whatever the church in Sudan goes through is allowed by God because he wants to see a stronger church.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Whatever the church in Sudan goes through is allowed by God because he wants to see a stronger church.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe God was using that message to prepare them for this. I told them to reflect on that\u2014God knew this was coming.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, the Bible shows us God allows these situations not because he wants people to be killed but because he wants to change something that isn\u2019t good in their lives. The people in north Sudan have often attacked those in the east, west, and south parts, often without thinking of the damage they were causing. Now the war is taking place in their territory. It might be time for them to see how horrible it is when war happens in your own city. Perhaps after this, they will not be so quick to fight.<\/p>\n<h4>How can we pray for Sudan?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pray that God will protect the vulnerable. Pray that he will manifest himself in miraculous ways. Pray for hearts to be melted and reformed by God. Also pray that the people who participated in the atrocities will repent from what they have done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pray especially for the Christians, that they will remember God has not left them and the body of Christ worldwide is praying for them. Pray that God will protect them from diseases, because now they are drinking unclean water and sleeping where there are mosquitos. Please pray that God will lessen their trauma and strengthen them.<\/p>\n<h4>Sudan has been in a civil war for 46 of the last 70 years. It seems unlikely this will be resolved quickly. What\u2019s next?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Either one of the military leaders will be captured or killed, or the two of them will listen to the international community, stop fighting, and talk. The latter seems unlikely, so this could continue for many months and cause a lot of damage. I don\u2019t see the light yet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Christian refugees I talked to in Madani have already met with Christians in that city and joined their weekly fellowship and small groups. They&#8217;re encouraging one another and becoming bold in talking about Christ. Since everyone is occupied with the fighting, nobody is following them or trying to arrest them. So they&#8217;re singing and sharing the gospel with people in the neighborhood who are asking about their gatherings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that the church in the book of Acts was persecuted after the death of Stephen. The Bible says those who were scattered went around preaching the gospel. The Sudanese refugees know it might be a good time for them, despite the difficulties, to preach the gospel. They have already been boldly speaking about their faith.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Years ago, I read Alonzo L. McDonald\u2019s chapter in the book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/No-God-but-Breaking-Idols\/dp\/0802463363\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>No God but God<\/em><\/a> where he introduced the idea of a ministry \u201clife-cycle.\u201d When I adapt McDonald\u2019s life-cycle concept to teach about a ministry shelf life, I use five Ms: minister, ministry, movement, machine, and monument.\u202f<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Gospel movements typically begin with an individual <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">minister <\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\">whom God calls. Through a communication gift and the clarity of a compelling vision, the leader catalyzes gospel activity. Like a tractor beam, people are drawn to him, and the individual multiplies himself. He plants or cultivates growth in a church. The minister has become a <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">ministry<\/span><\/i>\u2014<span data-contrast=\"none\">the person leads a people\u2014and a unifying gospel cause inspires and coalesces their energy. Over time, that group&#8217;s synergy can even kindle a <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">movement. <\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\">A single church can birth a network, partnership, or denomination\u2014<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a fresh, prophetic, future-oriented, and expanding ministry work that may stretch beyond the leader&#8217;s original vision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But as this growth comes and time passes, the need to organize arises. Authority must be mapped, beliefs defined, and culture codified. Vital steps toward institutionalizing must be taken to protect the quality and sustainability of the movement. Sadly, if leaders don&#8217;t work hard to cultivate ongoing ministry life, the <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">movement can become a machine and then finally a monument\u2014a motionless statue fit only to be eulogized by those who remember its history.<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u202f<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:330}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What do leaders in churches and ministries need to be aware of to guard themselves against the slow death McDonald described? What means has God given network leaders for pursuing ongoing renewal?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 aria-level=\"3\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Guard Against the Dangers of Institutionalism<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Abraham Kuyper once <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Rooted-Grounded-Church-Organism-Institution\/dp\/193894853X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called<\/a> the church an \u201corganized organism.\u201d To organize, churches, and the networks who serve them, must institutionalize. The danger comes when institutionalizing becomes <em>institutionalism<\/em>. I call this the \u201cmachine\u201d stage\u2014when the organic is organized right out of ministry, when mechanization devours dynamic life. Institutionalism occurs whenever a ministry or organization begins to exist more for those it employs than for those it serves. Polity and policy exert supremacy over the movement dynamics that once energized the cause.<\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This sets the stage for the final M: monument. When a machine runs too long without the fuel of renewal, what was once a movement grinds to a halt and becomes <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a shrine to a former period in the organization\u2019s life.\u202f<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:330}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Don\u2019t misunderstand me. The pursuit of organization and\u202f<\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">institutionalizing<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u202fdoesn\u2019t automatically trigger the vice of\u202f<\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">institutionalism<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\">. Like people, ministries age. The older people, families, churches, or networks get, the more they need to organize to truly flourish. Embracing systems and policies doesn&#8217;t automatically send us from movement to machine. The question isn\u2019t whether a movement will institutionalize but whether it will do so wisely.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:330}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 aria-level=\"3\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Multiplication: Central Dynamic for Renewal<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:40}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gcdiscipleship.com\/article-feed\/the-three-postures-of-personal-renewal-for-ministry-leaders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Renewal begins<\/a> with remembering the gospel and depending upon God in prayer. But we can&#8217;t stop there. A key organizational habit that pushes partnerships toward renewal and away from institutionalism is <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">multiplication<\/span><\/i>.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:330}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Even in a fallen world, healthy organisms multiply. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">God designed it this way from the beginning. In Genesis 1, God multiplied his image by creating man and woman. Then he commanded our first parents to be fruitful and\u202f<\/span>multiply<span data-contrast=\"none\">\u202fand fill the earth.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:330}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It shouldn\u2019t surprise us when we arrive in the New Testament that God calls the Twelve to multiply. Jesus commands multiplication in the Great Commission (Matt. 28:19). Then, in Acts, \u201cthe word of God increases and multiplies\u201d (2:24)\u2014believers multiply and churches multiply. In 2 Timothy 2:2, we\u2019re called to multiply ministry to the next generation. It\u2019s hard to read our Bibles and miss God\u2019s commitment and call to multiplication.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:330}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 aria-level=\"3\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Paul\u2019s Commitment to Multiplication<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:40}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<blockquote><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It\u2019s hard to read our Bible and miss God\u2019s commitment and call to multiplication.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In Romans 15:19, the apostle Paul says, \u201c<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">From Jerusalem and all the way around\u202fto Illyricum <\/span>I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ<span data-contrast=\"none\">.\u201d It\u2019s as if Paul looks back at the last stage of his ministry and hangs up a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner. How can this be? Is the ministry of the gospel ever done?\u202f<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:330}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Illyricum was the region above Macedonia that ran parallel to Italy. Paul says the ministry of the gospel had been fulfilled from Illyricum all the way back to Jerusalem.\u202fWhat created this sense of accomplishment? Paul\u2019s extraordinary statement can only be assigned to one reality. Paul had planted churches from <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Jerusalem to Illyricum.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:330}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The churches Paul started were in strategic centers. Paul was confident people in each region would hear the name of Christ through<\/span> the evangelistic efforts of the churches. <span data-contrast=\"none\">For this reason, he could say the ministry of the gospel was complete. For the first apostles, pursuing renewal through church planting was the center point of Great Commission strategy. Multiplication should be our focus too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Right now, there are pastors and leaders praying, \u201cLord, help our church and network to be on mission. Help us to put the Great Commission into action.\u201d Friends, the way we do mission today is the same way it was done in the New Testament: We multiply. We plant local churches.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:330}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 aria-level=\"3\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Megavitamin of Multiplication<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:40}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Here\u2019s where we return to the lifecycle. Multiplication is both a mission to the world <em>and <\/em>a megavitamin for renewing churches and networks<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. For a partnership to be truly healthy, it must exist for something outside itself. Multiplication catalyzes renewal. When we neglect multiplication, our churches bend inward and we&#8217;re unable to see beyond ourselves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But when we pray and plan for multiplication, we enjoy the revitalizing nourishment that can only come from an outward push.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve all seen it. Church planters start their work through the generosity and the sacrifices of others but once their church is established, they lose the burden to do the same for the next generation. Or local churches settle for community, care, and corporation but see the cause of mission as too costly. In both cases, there&#8217;s a larger undetected cost.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For a partnership to be truly healthy, it must exist for something outside itself. Multiplication catalyzes renewal.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Local churches settle for community, care, and corporation. What\u2019s missing from that list is the cause of <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">mission<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. The Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea are both fed from the same source, but the Sea of Galilee is teeming with life while the Dead Sea, aptly named, is dark and, well, dead. What makes the difference? Outlets. When life flows <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">into <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">and <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">from <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">the body, it&#8217;s sustained <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">within <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">the body. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>The same is true for churches and the partnerships which unite them. Multiplication becomes the outlet allowing renewal nutrients to flow. When life flows into and from the body, churches multiply. Partnerships thrive. The lifecycle continues.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>The Western world\u2019s relationship to the Christian faith is like a celebrity marriage\u2014complicated.<\/p>\n<p>At one level, our culture\u2019s rejection of its ancestral faith has never been so enthusiastic, so complete, so aggressive. It looks, for all intents and purposes, like an acrimonious divorce. And yet our world remains deeply Christian.<\/p>\n<p>We continue to use the convictions, the thought forms, and even the metaphysics of the faith we&#8217;re so keen to reject. Our apparently self-evident commitments to equality, progress, and compassion are Christian artifacts, even as our relationship with the faith that bequeathed them to us comes unstuck.<\/p>\n<p>If these values are Christianity\u2019s children, their paternity is contested. Their family resemblance to the faith of Scripture isn\u2019t recognized because the image of their father has become so grainy and low-resolution in our minds that no memory is jogged. Our collective ignorance of Christianity\u2019s influence is so complete that we don\u2019t even stop to wonder where these values came from. We imagine these things are just <em>there<\/em>. Like a fish in water. Like the air we breathe.<\/p>\n<p>Enter Glen Scrivener\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Air-We-Breathe-Kindness-Christian\/dp\/1784987492\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Air We Breathe<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Debt to Christianity<\/h3>\n<p>Scrivener provides a compelling, well-researched, and confident account of the West\u2019s debt to Christianity in general and to Christ in particular. He calls out the negligent parents, produces the DNA test, and gently suggests to the readers some of their options in light of the results.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We continue to use the convictions, the thought forms, and even the metaphysics of the faith we&#8217;re so keen to reject.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Glen Scrivener is an Australian-born evangelist and apologist, now based in the U.K., whose suite of resources includes some brilliant spoken-word evangelistic videos on topics such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LyfXTBdegQM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Halloween<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yNWs37HQ2EQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christmas<\/a>, which I often share during the relevant seasons. His latest book has been widely acclaimed, winning both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/tgc-book-awards-2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Gospel Coalition\u2019s<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.christianitytoday.com\/ct\/2023\/januaryfebruary\/christianity-today-2023-book-awards.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christianity Today\u2019s<\/a> 2022 book awards in the evangelism and apologetics categories.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the West\u2019s strange silence on the source of many of its most treasured values, Scrivener joins a growing host of whistle-blowers. Tom Holland\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dominion-Christian-Revolution-Remade-World\/dp\/1541675592\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World<\/em><\/a> (Basic Books, 2019) is a magisterial account of similar space from a secular perspective. John Dickson\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bullies-Saints-Honest-Christian-History\/dp\/0310118360\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Bullies and Saints: An Honest Look at the Good and Evil of Christian History<\/em><\/a> (Zondervan, 2021) comes from the perspective of a Christian historian, and David Bentley Hart\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Atheist-Delusions-Christian-Revolution-Fashionable\/dp\/0300164297\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Atheist Delusions: The Christian Revolution and Its Fashionable Enemies<\/em><\/a> (Yale University Press, 2009) from a theologian. Scrivener comes in as a straight-up evangelist. And it works. Brilliantly.<\/p>\n<p>The writing is full of pluck and warmth. Despite its intellectual rigor, the book\u2019s tone is more that of an animated late-night argument in a pub\u2014 friendly but with no holds barred. It\u2019s written to be read. And the chances you\u2019ll finish it having started it are extremely high. The hard-to-put-down force is strong with this one.<\/p>\n<h3>Mixed Audience<\/h3>\n<p>Scrivener has three audiences in mind: the \u201cnones,\u201d the \u201cdones\u201d and the \u201cwons.\u201d The \u201cnones\u201d are that increasing group who answer \u201cnone\u201d when asked about their religion. These are the book&#8217;s primary target group\u2014those (often left-leaning) secular Westerners who are simultaneously the most enthusiastic about many uniquely Christian values and the least likely to know where those values came from. These \u201cnones\u201d often carry an unreflective assumption that the equality of all humans, the value of compassion, and the hope of progress are self-evident. Scrivener means to disabuse them of this assumption.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cdones\u201d are those who were once Christian or Christian-adjacent but are now done with it all. This depressingly fast-growing group (like their secular progressive counterparts) doesn&#8217;t usually wander off into some post-ethical wasteland. More often than not, they double down on particular values, such as freedom and concern for people on the margins, even as they consider themselves \u201cdone\u201d (for whatever reasons) with the faith that first gave those values prominence.<\/p>\n<p>And the \u201cwons\u201d are those who have been won by Christ. For this last group (which probably includes the majority of those reading this review), Scrivener means to fortify our hearts and fill our cups with confidence and evangelistic spunk.<\/p>\n<h3>Haunted by Christ<\/h3>\n<p>Scrivener explores seven deeply held moral or epistemic convictions: equality, compassion, consent, enlightenment, science, freedom, and progress. In each case, he demonstrates that these values, far from being as self-evident as \u201cthe air we breathe,\u201d are the products of Christianity. He explores how Christ continues (as Flannery O\u2019Connor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mystery-Manners-Occasional-Prose-Classics\/dp\/0374508046\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">puts it<\/a>) to haunt our culture.<\/p>\n<p>The argument is compelling and communication style vivid and energetic. The chapters move more or less chronologically from the birth of Christianity to the present day. We begin with a picture of the ancient world, and, like a printing press adding one color after another, the book slowly composes a rich picture of how we got from the classical world to our world.<\/p>\n<p>How did we come from a world in which equality was unthinkable, compassion undesirable, and consent unimportant to one in which, on May 25, 2020, the death of George Floyd sent us into collective convulsions of moral outrage? Such a response was, in the classical world, unimaginable. By 2020 it was inevitable. Why? The reason, in a word, is Christ.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Scrivener means to fortify our hearts and fill our cups with confidence and evangelistic spunk.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Some books on this topic are written in service of the culture wars, providing a theological argument for why the &#8220;West is Best.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t that book.<\/p>\n<p>Others in this genre can be overly timid, addressing the modern, secular person as if Christianity was the beta version of the moral certitudes progressive secularists now enjoy. &#8220;Christianity wasn\u2019t quite feminist, or LBGT-affirming, or 100 percent against slavery, but, hey! Look at the trajectory! Can we please have partial credit?&#8221; This isn&#8217;t that book either.<\/p>\n<p>Scrivener\u2019s book is neither cultural warrior nor apologetic apologist. It\u2019s <em>evangel<\/em>. It\u2019s pugnacious, confident, and willing to call out the assumptions and blind spots of its reader. It leaves us neither sentimental about our past nor smug about our present. It challenges us, calling the reader (respectfully and generously) to be more evidence-based, more critical, and less susceptible to the kind of magical thinking that says these things just are.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Air We Breathe<\/em> is a swashbuckling adventure ride of a book. It\u2019s academically grounded, culturally attuned, and full of evangelistic chutzpah. I\u2019d put this into the hands of any of my secular friends in a heartbeat.<\/p>\n",

If only one lesson of this book stays with you, let it be this: salt has a greater impact on flavor than any other ingredient.<\/p>\n<p>Nosrat asserts, \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re hardwired to crave salt to ensure we get enough of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Christians understand \u201cthe salt of the earth\u201d as one of the master metaphors of our relationship to wider human society. When the church\u2019s witness with respect to the unbelieving world is discussed, our calling as \u201csalt and light\u201d is often one of the first identifications to be invoked, and rightly so.<\/p>\n<p>The Lord Jesus designates his disciples as the \u201csalt of the earth\u201d and \u201clight of the world\u201d (Matt. 5:13\u201314) immediately following the mountaintop benediction he pronounces upon them in the Beatitudes (vv. 1\u201312). If the Beatitudes are the kingdom constitution, then being \u201csalt and light\u201d is how the citizens of the kingdom are to walk in holy distinction from the course of a world that has its own charter centered in the sinful self with its deceitful desires (cf. Eph. 2:2; 4:22).<\/p>\n<p>Because it\u2019s so foundational, understanding the nature and purpose of the image of \u201csalt\u201d in Matthew 5:13 is vital. The church fulfills her calling as \u201cthe salt of the earth\u201d in serving as the taste of the kingdom of heaven, and that in doing so the body of Christ invites the world to the feast of life in the kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Salt&#8221; in Matthew 5 isn&#8217;t referring to the flavor and seasoning believers bring to human life and society. It\u2019s rather to be taken as signifying the beginnings of the heavenly banquet whose foretaste is found in the church of Christ. Like the pomegranates, figs, and grapes brought back to Israel in the wilderness by the spies (Num. 13:23, 26), believers\u2019 communion in life as the \u201csalt of the earth\u201d is a proleptic experience of the fullness of the age to come.<\/p>\n<h3>Taste of the Coming Age<\/h3>\n<p>There are various functions salt serves, but the particular aspect of the salt to which Jesus is referring is its taste: \u201cIf the salt <em>has lost<\/em> <em>its flavor<\/em> . . .\u201d (\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u1fc7).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The body of Christ invites the world to the feast of life in the kingdom.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If the danger is for the salt to become tasteless or flavorless, then by implication the Lord is commanding the disciples to keep their distinct flavor. And what is that flavor? To continue to walk in the way of blessedness as unpacked in verses 1\u201312. This is the way to exhibit the \u201csalt life\u201d of God\u2019s redemptive kingdom. Don Garlington helpfully <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsjets.org\/files\/JETS-PDFs\/54\/54-4\/JETS_54-4_715-748_Garlington.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes<\/a>,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Because they exhibit the qualities signaled by the indicatives of Matt 5:3\u201312, the disciples are proof positive that the kingdom is a reality in the world. It is just in their capacity as \u201cthe poor in spirit,\u201d \u201cthose who mourn,\u201d \u201cthe meek,\u201d \u201cthose who hunger and thirst for righteousness,\u201d \u201cthe merciful,\u201d \u201cthe pure in heart,\u201d \u201cthe peacemakers,\u201d and the \u201cpersecuted\u201d that Jesus\u2019 followers are salt and light and, as such, the eschatological reality of the kingdom is actualized in their persons as the subjects of his reign.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, Jesus isn\u2019t referring to salt penetrating or permeating the earth so that his disciples show forth a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/23950201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sweetening and wholesome influence<\/a>.\u201d Instead, the salt represents the savor of the age to come, and the disciples walking in the ways of the kingdom of God are calling those from the kingdom of this world to leave the bitter course of the place of darkness (cf. Matt. 4:15\u201316).<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s an implicit invitation contained in the \u201csalt of the earth\u201d image: as the nations are being discipled (28:19), they share in the \u201csalt life\u201d of the new order inaugurated in Christ. Rudolf Schnackenburg <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Gospel-Matthew-Rudolf-Schnackenburg\/dp\/0802844383\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concludes<\/a>, \u201cTogether with the image of the lamp, it [the salt] is an appeal to the community of disciples to bear witness to the gospel, in the midst of a world still averse to it, by living a life in conformity with Jesus\u2019 instructions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the flavor of the salt will be to practice the righteousness that exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees (5:20). This fits with one of the larger themes in the Sermon on the Mount: the kingdom that Christ is inaugurating stands in continuity with \u201cthe Law and the Prophets\u201d\u2014as Jesus comes not to abolish but to fulfill them (v. 17); at the same time, this kingdom supersedes the prior expression of God\u2019s reign as revealed at Sinai (cf. vv. 38\u201342).<\/p>\n<h3>Warning<\/h3>\n<p>The warning of Jesus concerning the salt may be the most significant clue concerning the purpose of this image. There\u2019s a double entendre in \u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u1fc7: it&#8217;s both \u201closing flavor\u201d and \u201cbecoming foolish.\u201d Paul writes, \u201cClaiming to be wise, they became fools [\u1f10\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd].\u201d Robert Gundry, in a thorough study of \u201cfools\u201d and \u201cfoolish\u201d in Matthew, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Matthew-Commentary-Handbook-Church-Persecution\/dp\/0802807356\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concludes<\/a> that \u201cfool(ish)\u201d is always associated with those who are outside the kingdom of heaven. It\u2019s possible for those who are called to be salt to lose flavor in severing themselves from Christ and the wisdom revealed in him (cf. Gal. 5:4; 2 John 8).<\/p>\n<p>Here the Lord appears to be hinting at the failure of Israel to maintain fidelity to the covenant. The order of the Beatitudes and the warning given in Matthew 5:13 reflects the prayer of restoration of the psalmist: \u201cLet me hear what God the LORD will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints; but let them not turn back to folly\u201d (Ps. 85:8).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf the salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people\u2019s feet\u201d (Matt. 5:13). This serves to alert the disciples (the new Israel) to vigilance and also as a harbinger of what will become of the old Israel that rejects Christ and his kingdom. John the Baptist had earlier announced, \u201cEven now the axe is laid to the root of the trees\u201d (3:10). Jesus prophesies concerning the unbelieving Jerusalem and her inhabitants, who have definitively rejected his words: \u201cThey will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be <em>trampled underfoot<\/em> by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled\u201d (Luke 21:24).<\/p>\n<p>Later in Matthew, Jesus teaches in parables and likens the kingdom of heaven to a \u201cking who gave a wedding feast for his son, and sent his servant to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come\u201d (Matt. 22:2\u20133). Some are foolish (\u03b4\u1f72 \u1f10\u03be \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f26\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03af) in failing to be ready to meet the bridegroom (25:2). Those who fail to share in the joy of the messianic coming are culpably foolish.<\/p>\n<p>But though the original parties reject the invitation, the wedding feast will still be held:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u201cThe wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you can find.\u201d And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests. (22:8\u201310)<\/p>\n<p>The salt which stands for the flavor and fullness of the kingdom of God will be tasted by many who are far off (cf. Rom. 15:20\u201321; Eph. 2:17).<\/p>\n<h3>Setting the Kingdom Table<\/h3>\n<p>In my estimation, it\u2019s best to take salt in Matthew 5:13 as an example of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/metonymy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">metonymy<\/a>: \u201cA figure of speech consisting of the use of the name of one thing for that of another of which it is an attribute or with which it is associated.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For example, God\u2019s \u201cright hand\u201d stands for his incontestable power (cf. Pss. 98:1; 108:6). To hear of the Lord\u2019s \u201cright hand\u201d is to be summoned to consider the royal strength and sovereignty of the Most High.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Those who fail to share in the joy of the messianic coming are culpably foolish.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cSalt,\u201d rhetorically speaking, opens the door to the setting of the kingdom table: \u201cWisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars. She has slaughtered her beasts, she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table\u201d (Prov. 9:1\u20132). Jesus has already in Matthew 5 introduced the image of appetite and provision: \u201cBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied\u201d (v. 6). Salt according to the terms of this \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Philosophical-Investigations-Ludwig-Wittgenstein\/dp\/1405159286\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">language game<\/a>\u201d isn\u2019t found in the cupboard or in the shaker, waiting to be dispensed; instead, it belongs to the flavor ready to be tasted on the chef\u2019s table\u2014that is, already present in the life of the new creation reign of God in Christ.<\/p>\n<p>If indeed the <span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">salt of the earth\u201d metaphor is to be taken as the call for the church\u2019s continued testimony to and participation in the flavor of the kingdom of heaven, we should be wary of appropriating this verse as endorsing the idea that the church qua church exists to promote general human flourishing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Cultural and societal influence cannot be used as a barometer of the \u201csaltiness\u201d enjoined in Matthew 5:13. Inasmuch as the church is faithful in \u201cmaking disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that [Jesus has] commanded [us]\u201d (28:19\u201320), the unparalleled flavor of the kingdom of God, with the Savior-King himself, will be present to the end of the age.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h4>What just happened?<\/h4>\n<p>The Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON) recently met in Kigali, Rwanda, for its fourth meeting. During the event, attendees <a href=\"https:\/\/gafcon23.org\/media-release-21-april-2023-statement-committee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crafted and released<\/a> a statement called the &#8220;Kigali Commitment 2023.&#8221; The statement comments on eight separate topics, including the current crisis within the Anglican Communion, the failure of the current archbishop of Canterbury, and steps necessary for \u201cresetting the Communion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Kigali Commitment reflects the mind of the 1300 delegates here at this conference. They in turn represent most of the world\u2019s worshiping Anglicans (estimated to be around 85%),\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/gafcon23.org\/media-release-21-april-2023-conference-statement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">says Michael Stead<\/a>, bishop of South Sydney and chair of the GAFCON Statement Committee.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is clear from this conference that most of the world\u2019s Anglicans have lost confidence in the Archbishop of Canterbury to provide a godly way forward that will be acceptable to those who are committed to the truthfulness, clarity, sufficiency and authority of Scripture,&#8221; says Bishop Stead. &#8220;This grieves us, but it is they who have walked away from us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h4>What is GAFCON?<\/h4>\n<p>GAFCON is a movement of Anglican churches and leaders who hold to a biblically orthodox view of Christianity. It was formed in 2008 in response to what its members see as a drift away from biblical truth within the Anglican Communion. GAFCON seeks to unite and strengthen biblically orthodox Anglicans worldwide and to provide a platform for theological discussion and debate. It has established new Anglican jurisdictions and structures for faithful Anglicans who are pressured by or alienated from revisionist dioceses and provinces. GAFCON holds a regular conference and has its own primates&#8217; council (a primate is the chief archbishop or bishop of a province).<\/p>\n<h4>What was said in the Kigali Commitment?<\/h4>\n<p>The fourth GAFCON ended with a reading of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gafcon.org\/news\/gafcon-iv-the-kigali-commitment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kigali Commitment<\/a>, a document outlining the issues orthodox Anglicans have with the Communion and the steps needed to restore unity. Some of the main points of the document are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Anglican Communion has experienced persistent departures from the authority of God&#8217;s Word, and warnings from most Anglican primates have been disregarded.<\/li>\n<li>The latest departure is the General Synod of the Church of England&#8217;s majority vote in February 2023 to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/faqs-anglican-same-sex-marriage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enable same-sex couples to receive God&#8217;s blessing<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>The archbishop of Canterbury and other leaders of the Church of England have betrayed their vows to uphold and defend the truth taught in Scripture by publicly supporting same-sex blessings.<\/li>\n<li>The Instruments of Communion have failed to maintain true communion based on the Word of God and shared faith in Christ, and the call for &#8220;good disagreement&#8221; is rejected.<\/li>\n<li>Repentance is necessary for those who have denied the orthodox Christian faith, and until they repent, the Communion remains broken.<\/li>\n<li>The GAFCON primates have recognized new orthodox jurisdictions for faithful Anglicans and reiterate their support for those who are unable to remain in the Church of England.<\/li>\n<li>Appropriate pastoral care affirms faithfulness in marriage and abstinence in singleness, and it&#8217;s unloving to lead people into error by pretending God blesses sexually active relationships between two people of the same sex.<\/li>\n<li>Due to departures from orthodoxy, the archbishop of Canterbury can no longer be recognized as the &#8220;first among equals&#8221; of the primates, and the Communion needs to be reset and reordered.<\/li>\n<li>The future of the GAFCON movement will prioritize discipleship, evangelism, and mission; raising up the next generation of leaders; youth and children&#8217;s ministry; affirming and encouraging women&#8217;s ministry; demonstrating the compassion of Christ; supporting bishops&#8217; training; and building the bonds of fellowship and mutual edification.<\/li>\n<li>The establishment of a foundation endowment is endorsed to pursue these priorities and grow the work of the GAFCON movement.<\/li>\n<li>The group commits themselves &#8220;afresh to the gospel mission of proclaiming the crucified, risen and ascended Christ, calling on all to acknowledge him as Lord in repentance and faith, and living out a joyful, faithful obedience to his Word in all areas of [their] lives.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>What is Anglicanism?<\/h4>\n<p>The Church of England and those churches with historical ties to it or who share its beliefs, modes of worship, and organizational structures are collectively referred to as belonging to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anglicanism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anglican tradition<\/a> within Christianity. After the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Anglican faith is the third-largest Christian communion in the world, with an estimated 85 million adherents worldwide (counting both those inside the Anglican Communion and Anglicans outside of it).<\/p>\n<h4>What is the Anglican Communion?<\/h4>\n<p>The Church of England and other national and regional Anglican churches in full communion with that mother church make up the Anglican Communion, a global organization of churches. All communicant Anglicans are eligible for full participation in the sacramental life of each church and are in agreement on all fundamental principles, according to the state of full communion. There are other groups whose affiliation with the global Anglican Communion is still being discussed, such as those connected to the <a href=\"http:\/\/anglicansonline.org\/communion\/nic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Continuing Anglican movement<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anglican_realignment\">Anglican realignment<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some member churches ordain LGBT+ clergy or wed same-sex couples. These include the Episcopal Church (which has 100 dioceses in the U.S. and 12 additional dioceses or jurisdictions spread across 15 countries in Asia, the Pacific, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe); the Episcopal Anglican Church of Brazil; the Anglican Church of Canada; the Scottish Episcopal Church; the Church in Wales; and the Anglican Church of Aotearoa, New Zealand, and Polynesia.<\/p>\n<h4>What is the significance of the archbishop of Canterbury?<\/h4>\n<p>The churches of the Anglican Communion are \u201clinked by affection and common loyalty\u201d and in communion with the See of Canterbury. The term \u201cSee\u201d refers to the seat of a bishop, thus the \u201cSee of Canterbury\u201d refers to the position held by the archbishop of Canterbury\u2014the highest-ranking bishop in Canterbury, one of two ecclesiastical provinces which constitute the Church of England.<\/p>\n<p>Since there&#8217;s no binding authority in the Anglican Communion (the archbishop of Canterbury has no authority outside of his own province), the \u201cInstruments of Unity\u201d serve to hold the various churches and provinces together:\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">the <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.lambethconference.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lambeth Conference<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u00a0is a gathering of bishops, meeting every 10 years; the\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.anglicancommunion.org\/communion\/primates\/index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">meeting of primates<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> (in which the archbishop is <em>primus inter pares<\/em>, the first among equals) takes place every two or three years for consultation on theological, social, and international issues; and the <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.anglicancommunion.org\/communion\/acc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anglican Consultative Council<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> brings together bishops, presbyters, deacons, lay men and women, and youth to work on common concerns.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>What is the possible significance of this response for the Anglican Communion?<\/h4>\n<p>The Anglicans within GAFCON have boldly placed the blame for disunity within the Communion on those who are choosing to abandon the authority of Scripture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe current divisions in the Anglican Communion have been caused by radical departures from the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d notes the Kigali Commitment. \u201cSome within the Communion have been taken captive by hollow and deceptive philosophies of this world (Colossians 2:8).\u201d The statement adds that \u201cfellowship is broken when we turn aside from God\u2019s Word or attempt to reinterpret it in any way that overturns the plain reading of the text in its canonical context and so deny its truthfulness, clarity, sufficiency, and thereby its authority.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While the changes proposed by GAFCON will have significant effects on the structure of the Anglican movement, the most important effect is that it shows church discipline sometimes needs to be implemented on a large scale\u2014and that even the highest leaders in an organization can be called to repent when they abandon God\u2019s Word.<\/p>\n<p>Church discipline should be a deliberate, forbearing, and loving process. Over the past 25 years, orthodox Anglicans have met that standard by patiently calling their fellow believers within the Communion to repent and to once again submit to the authority of Scripture. Regrettably, their calls have been largely unheeded\u2014even by the archbishop of Canterbury\u2014and so the Anglicans in GAFCON must separate themselves from the unrepentant (Matt. 18:17).<\/p>\n<p>The process of separation will be painful for them and will likely take years to complete. But their example is showing Christians around the globe what it looks like to remain faithful to Christ in an age of compromise.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>What is Christian Nationalism? Maybe this is a tired question, and you&#8217;re weary of reading about the topic. But in some ways, our perspective on the issue is clearer now than it was in the weeks and months and years since the phrase came into the national spotlight. The dust has somewhat settled, and the time for hot takes has ended.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cChristian Nationalism\u201d has become a junk box into which everyone piles his own conceptions. But it&#8217;s not monolithic. Three dominant perspectives on Christian Nationalism have arisen over the past several years. Some equate Christian Nationalism with rioting at the U.S. Capitol on January 6. Others say it&#8217;s any attempt to enforce God\u2019s law in a country. Others claim it&#8217;s advocating for Christian values on issues such as abortion. How you view the movement depends almost entirely on your circles.<\/p>\n<p>To maintain the unity established by the Spirit, Christians must ask what a person means by a phrase before we jump to judgment. We want to be quick to listen and slow to speak (James 1:9). We should hear out three different forms of Christian Nationalism and evaluate each one.<\/p>\n<p>Although different Christian traditions view the church-state relationship dissimilarly, my analysis comes from a Baptist perspective. Baptists have long advocated for religious freedom and the separation of church and state. Baptists have been wary of theonomy, but have supported governments instituted by God while engaging in political dissent as needed.<\/p>\n<h3>Good: Influence of Christianity in American Civil Life<\/h3>\n<p>For some, Christian Nationalism simply means that <em>Christianity has influenced and should continue to influence the nation<\/em>. They argue America was founded on transcendent Christian principles. The Declaration of Independence affirms \u201call men are created equal\u201d and \u201care endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d Such a principle is worthy of Christian advocacy alongside a biblical view of issues like marriage, sexuality, and abortion. Our nation would be improved by affirming the goodness of natural law principles.<\/p>\n<p>In the best sense, this form of Christian Nationalism doesn\u2019t attempt to dominate the political process or to make the nation completely Christian but seeks instead to bring change by persuasion. Rather than trying to overthrow the government, adherents advocate their cause by supporting laws, electing candidates, podcasting, writing, and developing think tanks. They won\u2019t force their opinions, but they also won&#8217;t back down from arguing for them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/christian-nationalism-patriotism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Religion will always have a place in politics<\/a>. Everyone has a \u201creligion\u201d she promotes. The best form of Christian Nationalism advocates for Christian principles just like secular nationalism advocates for secular principles.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Religion will always have a place in politics. Everyone has a \u2018religion\u2019 she promotes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If a Christian Nationalist is someone who believes that as citizens our views should influence our nation, then surely every Christian falls under that label. But this isn&#8217;t what most people mean by Christian Nationalism.<\/p>\n<h3>Bad: Fusion of Christianity and American Civil Life<\/h3>\n<p>Some view Christian Nationalism as a <em>fusion of Christianity with American civil life<\/em>. Although this might not sound different from the above, a fusion means Christianity and American life should coalesce. The political process should be overhauled to serve God. The laws of the United States should be explicitly Christian.<\/p>\n<p>The fusion view is flawed in at least three ways. First, it contradicts the Christian philosophy of witness. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/essay\/the-relationship-of-church-and-state\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christ\u2019s kingdom is to be advocated by persuasion, not power<\/a>. Conversion must be a free choice, not instituted by command\u2014compelled by the Spirit rather than instituted by human law. According to John in Revelation, Christians follow Christ in his victory primarily by witnessing to the reign of Christ, not by enacting laws. We follow a politic of persuasion all the way down. Revelation 12:11 says we conquer by the \u201cword of [our] testimony.\u201d We imitate Christ\u2019s victory through suffering. This is our main political witness. We conquer not by fighting the culture war but by embodying Jesus\u2019s cross-shaped victory. His blood declares him the King of the universe, and our blood speaks to our solidarity with him. We continue to speak of and demonstrate Jesus\u2019s cross in our own lives and so remain faithful in a pagan society.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the fusion view doesn\u2019t respect the temporal distinction between this age and the age to come. We live in the gap between Christ\u2019s resurrection and his second coming. In this time, religious freedom, diversity, and pluralism are blessings to God\u2019s people who wish to live a \u201cpeaceful and quiet life\u201d (1 Tim. 2:2). In this age, we can&#8217;t institute or codify God\u2019s law in totality. That day will come, but it will be done by Christ himself\u2013\u2013the true King. As citizens of the kingdom of God, we point forward to the kingdom but never forget the age we inhabit. We live in the age of choice. God has honored humans enough to give them time to repent. This doesn\u2019t mean neglecting the natural order God created for humanity\u2019s good, but it also doesn\u2019t mean seeking to establish the theocratic state.<\/p>\n<p>Third, this form of Christian Nationalism goes against key features of the American experiment, mainly pluralism and religious liberty. The First Amendment of the Constitution says, &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&#8221; Although America does have a distinctly Christian past, this form of Christian Nationalism overlooks the pluralism and religious liberty for which many founding fathers advocated. Eliminating all dissent might sound attractive, and it certainly would allow governing authorities to get things done more quickly. But squashing dissent violates human liberty, equality, and the vision of the founding fathers. It requires coercion of and change from those who dissent. If taken to its logical conclusion, this Nationalism undermines the foundation of a free society. Should such a fusion dominate American civil life, it would divide the nation rather than unify it. Uniformity in some aspects of national life isn\u2019t all bad, but that must always exist beside diversity.<\/p>\n<p>For all these reasons, this form of Christian Nationalism is unbiblical, idealistic, and philosophically unsound. Yet this view remains &#8220;bad&#8221; and not &#8220;ugly&#8221; because they&#8217;re not trying to overthrow the government. Our critiques of the fusion view, then, should sound different than our rebuke of a darker form of Christian Nationalism.<\/p>\n<h3>Ugly: Dominion of Christianity over American Civil Life<\/h3>\n<p>Christian Nationalism can also turn ugly. It can become <em>a cultural framework that idealizes and advocates for a fusion of Christianity with American civil life and does so by dominion<\/em>. This is the type of Christian Nationalism exhibited by some on January 6. This is the complete conflation of God and country and advocating for it by force or violence when deemed necessary.<\/p>\n<p>The critiques of the second position apply here as well, but the phrase \u201cChristian Nationalism\u201d is, at its core, a confusion of categories. Although we can affirm and even celebrate the role Christianity has played in America as a nation, America can\u2019t ever be described as a \u201cChristian nation.\u201d No nation-state can be a Christian nation-state, because Christianity doesn\u2019t work that way.<\/p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Scandalous-Witness-Political-Manifesto-Christians\/dp\/0802877354\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lee Camp<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Political-Gospel-Public-Witness-Politically\/dp\/1087755174\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I have suggested<\/a>, Christianity and nation-states are two vastly different entities. In terms of access, people enter Christianity by voluntary intention (faith and baptism) but usually enter nation-states by arbitrary historical accident (being born in the region). Geographically, Christianity is transnational and bounded by no lines, but all nation-states are defined by borders.<\/p>\n<p>Nation-states defend their borders by using military might and building walls, but Christianity breaks down ethnic barriers and crosses borders to welcome all who repent and believe. Unlike nation-states where the citizens are largely monocultural, Christianity encourages diversity and multiformity.<\/p>\n<p>Nation-states are interested in their own agendas, but Christians put others before themselves. Nation-states see their own shortcomings as not living up to their ideals and potential, but Christians recognize their shortcomings stem from their corrupt nature. The hope of nation-states is utopia by their own ingenuity, but Christianity says utopia will only be brought by another.<\/p>\n<p>The following table summarizes these differences:<\/p>\n<div>\n<div style=\"margin: 20px;\">\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"LIGHTGRAY\" width=\"623\"><strong>The Difference Between Nation-States and Christianity<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td bgcolor=\"LIGHTGRAY\" width=\"101\"><strong>Category <\/strong><\/td>\n<td bgcolor=\"LIGHTGRAY\" width=\"280\"><strong>Nation-States<\/strong><\/td>\n<td bgcolor=\"LIGHTGRAY\" width=\"243\"><strong>Christianity<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"101\"><strong>Entrance<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"280\">Arbitrary historical accident<\/td>\n<td width=\"243\">Voluntary intention<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"101\"><strong>Geography<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"280\">Borders<\/td>\n<td width=\"243\">Transnational<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"101\"><strong>Defense<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"280\">Army, military, building walls<\/td>\n<td width=\"243\">Erases borders, breaks down walls<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"101\"><strong>Citizens<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"280\">Monochromatic<\/td>\n<td width=\"243\">Multiform<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"101\"><strong>Agenda<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"280\">Their own interests<\/td>\n<td width=\"243\">The interests of others<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"101\"><strong>Shortcoming<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"280\">Not living up to potential and ideals<\/td>\n<td width=\"243\">Corrupt nature<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"101\"><strong>Hope<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"280\">In their own ingenuity<\/td>\n<td width=\"243\">In the work of another<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>To claim America is a Christian nation confuses categories.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>To claim America is a Christian nation confuses categories.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/reviews\/christian-nationalism-wolfe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrongheaded to try to enforce the fusion by force<\/a>. Jesus explicitly said his kingdom is not of this world. If it were, his servants would fight (John 18:36). We advocate for the end of abortion, but we don\u2019t kill doctors who perform abortions. We can march and protest, but we don\u2019t form mobs of destruction. We work to elect candidates of integrity and conviction, but we don\u2019t harass public officials at town halls or school board meetings.<\/p>\n<p>When Jesus was arrested, his disciples asked him, \u201cShall we strike with the sword?\u201d (Luke 22:49). Then Peter struck the high priest\u2019s servant and cut off his right ear. But Jesus said, \u201cPut your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword&#8221; (Matt. 26:52). No biblical view of Christian political engagement can include violence as endorsed by the dominion view.<\/p>\n<h3>More Definition, Not Less<\/h3>\n<p>To speak of \u201cChristian Nationalism\u201d is to open the door to disagreement. We must define what we mean by our terms. <a href=\"https:\/\/lawliberty.org\/features\/the-many-faces-of-christian-nationalism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Wilsey is right to say<\/a> Christian Nationalism &#8220;has often been articulated in ways that pervert Christianity\u2019s message. But we should work to understand it, and when we condemn it, we should do it in precise terms.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By using these three categories for understanding Christian Nationalism and critiquing each one on its own terms, we can remain hopeful for change and clarity as we continue to discuss <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/podcasts\/gospelbound\/christian-nationalism-heresy-or-hype\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the relationship of Christianity to politics<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

    },

      "rendered": "<p>Pastors and theological students have long prized commentaries. Charles Spurgeon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccel.org\/ccel\/spurgeon\/comment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called<\/a> biblical commentators \u201ca glorious army . . . whose acquaintance will be your delight and profit.\u201d He remarked that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Matthew-Henrys-Commentary-Whole-Bible\/dp\/1598566121\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matthew Henry\u2019s work<\/a> should be \u201cchained in the vestry for anybody and everybody to read\u201d and considered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Commentary-Old-New-Testaments-Volumes\/dp\/1601789718\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Trapp<\/a> his &#8220;especial companion and treasure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While pastors today still read Henry, Calvin, and other classics from centuries past, numerous commentary series and stand-alone volumes published in recent years offer students of the Scriptures a wide range of options\u2014and opinions. To adapt the words of the ancient Preacher, \u201cOf making many commentaries there is no end.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The practice of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Writing-New-Testament-Commentaries-Festschrift\/dp\/9004232915\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commenting on important works<\/a> goes back to ancient Athens and was advanced by literary scholars in Alexandria. Antiquity\u2019s most prolific commentator, Didymus of Alexandria, <a href=\"https:\/\/topostext.org\/work\/736#:~:text=%C2%A7%2088.37%C2%A0%C2%A0Why%3F%20Because,life%20is%20long!\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote<\/a> between 3,500 and 4,000 works. Early Christian commentators include Hippolytus of Rome (on Daniel) and Origen (on Matthew, John, and Romans) in the early third century.<\/p>\n<h3>Purpose of Commentaries<\/h3>\n<p>Most fundamentally, commentaries seek to explain the sense of a written work. In his work on <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Iliad-Homer\/dp\/0140275363\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Iliad<\/a><\/em>, Aristarchus of Samothrace tried \u201cto explain Homer by Homer, to interpret him by himself.\u201d In the biblical tradition, commentators take their cues from the Levites who \u201cread from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people understood what was being read\u201d (Neh. 8:8, NIV).<\/p>\n<p>Commentaries are written on texts that are important for a community of readers and require explanation due to factors such as historical distance, differences in language, and challenging subject matter. First-century Hellenistic readers sought commentaries to make sense of Homer and Aristotle. How much more necessary are good commentaries that help contemporary Christian readers understand the authoritative canonical texts written thousands of years ago in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.<\/p>\n<p>There are various sorts of biblical commentaries and series that reflect distinctive emphases. Some seek to illuminate the text\u2019s historical-cultural context (e.g., <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B075TV7N2R?binding=hardcover\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Zondervan Illustrated Bible Backgrounds Commentary<\/a><\/em>). Others help readers navigate its original language and syntax (e.g., <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B08LKMC2V4?binding=paperback\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baylor Handbook on the Greek New Testament<\/a><\/em> and <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B08C36BY84?binding=paperback\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Exegetical Guide to the Greek New Testament<\/a><\/em>). Others review the text\u2019s reception history (e.g., <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B088R5JY88?binding=hardcover\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hermeneia<\/a><\/em> and <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Matthew-Through-Centuries-Blackwell-Commentaries\/dp\/111858886X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wiley Blackwell Bible Commentaries<\/a><\/em>). Still others focus on the text\u2019s contribution to biblical theology or its enduring theological and pastoral significance (e.g., <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B08VDYYC2V?binding=hardcover\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Evangelical Biblical Theology Commentary<\/a><\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>Some well-rounded series are particularly well suited to the needs of pastors and theological students, such as the <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B085G86561?binding=hardcover\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baker Exegetical Commentary<\/a><\/em>, <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B08C5LRPVC?binding=hardcover\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pillar New Testament Commentary<\/a><\/em>, <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B08PKSYD3Q?binding=hardcover\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zondervan Exegetical Commentary<\/a><\/em>, and <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0BYJGFNZ7?binding=hardcover\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New International Commentary<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of commentaries\u2019 intended scope and audience, they share a common concern to orient readers to the text and clarify its meaning.<\/p>\n<h3>Limitations of Commentaries<\/h3>\n<p>G. K. Chesterton <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Orthodoxy-annotations-guided-reading-Trevin\/dp\/153599567X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">famously quipped<\/a>, \u201cThough St John the Evangelist saw many strange monsters in his vision, he saw no creature so wild as one of his own commentators\u201d (a sobering word as I write a commentary on the Apocalypse). It\u2019s a daunting task to write a commentary (unless your name is Didymus), and many critics have chastised commentators for their deficiencies and limitations.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Good commentaries help contemporary Christian readers understand the authoritative canonical texts written thousands of years ago.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For example, Marita Mathijsen rehearses the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Text-Positionen-Perspektiven-German\/dp\/3503049762\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seven deadly sins<\/a>\u201d of commentary writing:<\/p>\n<p>1. Assembling a hodgepodge of facts in search of comprehensiveness<\/p>\n<p>2. Offering dictionary definitions for terms without really clarifying the text\u2019s meaning<\/p>\n<p>3. Including anecdotes and other information that&#8217;s interesting but not essential for understanding the text<\/p>\n<p>4. Failing to explain terms, customs, institutions, and actions in their historical context<\/p>\n<p>5. Proposing solutions to riddles that introduce further riddles (which she likens to the mythical Hydra that grows new heads after the first is cut off)<\/p>\n<p>6. Presenting condensed textual explanations that include a dizzying maze of abbreviations and references to various other works<\/p>\n<p>7. Presenting various lists, references, and facts in an arid style that doesn\u2019t serve the reader<\/p>\n<p>New Testament commentators may also go astray by treating the text in a fragmented, atomistic way that leads readers to miss the forest for the trees and by adopting new hermeneutical fads in their search for novelty or originality.<\/p>\n<h3>Essential Tool, Poor Substitute<\/h3>\n<p>Stated positively, a good commentary faithfully and lucidly explains the meaning of the biblical text in its literary and historical-cultural context. It doesn\u2019t simply rehash the opinions of all who\u2019ve gone before but offers fresh insights based on rigorous and careful examination of the text with awareness of the larger scholarly discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Trusted commentaries are an essential part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/build-theological-library\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">theological library<\/a>, taking their place alongside standard lexicons, Bible dictionaries, and works of historical, systematic, biblical, and pastoral theology. While consulting commentaries is valuable, it\u2019s a poor substitute for doing the hard work of carefully and prayerfully poring over the biblical text in its original language and in good translations.<\/p>\n<p>As Johann Albrecht Bengel famously said, \u201cApply yourself wholly to the text; apply the text wholly to yourself.\u201d Once pastors and theological students have reflected deeply on a text\u2019s literary context, considered its flow of thought, and wrestled with its meaning and significance, they\u2019re ready to receive the full benefits of wise, learned commentaries.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">William Carey (1761\u20131834) is often called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/reviews\/faithful-witness-william-carey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the father of modern missions<\/a>. Indeed, he proved innovative in founding the Baptist Missionary Society in 1792 and through pioneering Bible translation in India. Carey also broke new ground in 1800 when he helped launch the Serampore mission\u2014a team of three families that lived and served together in the Danish colony of Serampore near Calcutta.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While forming a missionary team in his day was already innovative, Carey\u2019s 1805 draft of the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wmcarey.edu\/carey\/gsmith\/append.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Serampore Form of Agreement<\/a>\u201d was also ahead of its time. Following a brief introduction acknowledging God\u2019s sovereignty in salvation and the imperative to proclaim the gospel, Carey laid out 10 \u201cgreat principles\u201d\u2014a mix of convictions, values, and strategies\u2014for the Serampore team in India.<\/p>\n<h4>Article 1: Lostness<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emphasizing the \u201cvalue of souls,\u201d Carey kept the spiritual lostness and eternal destiny of the peoples of India before their team so they would labor with urgency. Without losing that focus, he also encouraged his colleagues with the truth of the resurrection and God\u2019s mighty power to save. A reflection of his Reformed theology, these values also inform his famous maxim \u201cExpect great things from God, attempt great things for him.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Article 2: Ethnography<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Agreement advocated learning Indian cultures, worldviews, and religions to \u201cbe able to converse with [Indian peoples] in an intelligible manner.\u201d Carey called his team to be students of their host culture by dialoguing with local people, reading books by Indian authors, and cultivating the habit of observation. Today, we call this ethnographic study that leads to cultural intelligence. Though Carey was never formally trained in cultural anthropology, because of this value, he served for 30 years as a professor of languages and culture at Fort William College.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Carey called his team to be students of their host culture by dialoguing with local people, reading books by Indian authors, and cultivating the habit of observation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>Article 3: Contextualization<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey called the Serampore team to emulate the apostle Paul, becoming \u201call things to all people\u201d (1 Cor. 9:22). As well as building bridges, Carey added that they should also \u201cabstain from those things which would increase . . . prejudices against the gospel.\u201d In the Hindu context, this meant avoiding cruelty to animals and refraining from attacking Hindu beliefs.<\/p>\n<h4>Article 4: Diligence<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey recognized that the team could become complacent with mediocre attention to ministry or even become physically fatigued because of the hot Indian climate. He exhorted his colleagues to pursue \u201call opportunities of doing good\u201d\u2014to work hard and be diligent every day in preaching the gospel and carrying out their ministries.<\/p>\n<h4>Article 5: Proclamation<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Carey felt it was vital to understand and connect with Indian culture, he believed that the central focus of their message\u2014\u201cthe great subject of our preaching\u201d\u2014should be \u201cChrist the crucified.\u201d Following the apostles, Paul, the Protestant Reformers, and John Wesley, Carey believed the most important message a Hindu could hear was that Christ had died and paid the penalty for sins.<\/p>\n<h4>Article 6: Relationships<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey believed that in addition to hearing the gospel message, the Indians should observe the reality of Christ in the Serampore team. This could only happen through deliberate relational proximity. Carey wanted their Indian friends to \u201cfeel quite at home in our company\u201d and for the team to be \u201ceasy of access.\u201d In this sense, they imitated Paul\u2019s posture toward the Thessalonians: \u201cBecause we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well\u201d (1 Thess. 2:8, NIV).<\/p>\n<h4>Article 7: Discipleship<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey also emphasized discipleship\u2014\u201cto build up, and watch over . . . souls.\u201d Like spiritual parents, the team should be patient and walk with new believers. They ought to nurture their disciples in the Scriptures and in following the example of Christ. Carey believed discipleship should also be holistic. Along with teaching Scripture, the team would help their disciples to become good citizens, honor the authorities, and find gainful employment.<\/p>\n<h4>Article 8: Indigeneity<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the longest article in the Agreement, taking up nearly a quarter of the entire document, Carey emphasized that India should be reached through indigenous missionaries. He wrote, \u201cIt is only by means of native preachers that we can hope for the universal spread of the gospel throughout this immense continent.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In addition to hearing the gospel message, Carey believed the Indians should observe the reality of Christ in the Serampore team.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anticipating the three-self strategy articulated in the mid-19th century (that churches should be self-led, self-supporting, and self-propagating), Carey believed national church leaders ought to \u201cchoose their pastors and deacons from amongst their own countrymen, that the word may be statedly preached, and the ordinances of Christ administered, in each church, by the native minister.\u201d This should be done \u201cwithout the interference\u201d of foreign missionaries.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to setting apart national pastors, Indian missionaries should also be sent \u201cto the extremities\u201d of the country, engaging the culture and preaching the gospel. With these values, Carey anticipated Hudson Taylor\u2019s vision to reach all of China and the 1910 Edinburgh World Missionary Conference\u2019s watchword, the \u201cevangelization of the world in this generation.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Article 9: Translation<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reach all of India, the Serampore team needed to \u201clabor with all [their] might in forwarding translations of the sacred Scriptures\u201d in every national language. Though Carey wasn&#8217;t trained in linguistics, he worked on Bible translation in 36 Indian languages, including a full Bible in three languages and a complete New Testament in 23 languages. Once translation had been completed, Carey also developed a strategy for distributing Scripture throughout the country.<\/p>\n<h4>Article 10: Spirituality<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey urged that the work of mission in India must be accomplished through fervent prayer and the \u201ccultivation of personal religion.\u201d To be faithful and even effective missionaries, the Serampore team should first attend to their spiritual lives.<\/p>\n<h3>Still Valuable<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey concluded the Agreement with a commitment to pursue mission work to the glory of God. The Serampore community remembered their vision and calling by reading the document at three set times a year during Lord\u2019s Day worship.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some of Carey\u2019s principles (e.g., ethnographic study, national missionaries, and Bible translation) were quite innovative to early 19th-century missions, the Agreement was probably more groundbreaking because it integrated Christian spirituality, a passion for God\u2019s glory, a burden for souls, theological reflection, and missiology in a single document. The Agreement became a concise strategic plan\u2014a memo of understanding\u2014for the Serampore team. To this day, it remains a useful model for mission teams and is worthy of our careful reflection.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p class=\"p1\">Over the last quarter century, the internet and social media have transformed our understanding of community. At first, it seemed like a promising transformation. The geography-transcending ease of online connection made it possible to quickly find people with shared passions and interests. Communities started forming around every conceivable pop culture or sports fandom, political perspective, social justice cause, hobby, fetish, philosophy, or religious inclination.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now, with the aid of tailored-to-you algorithms, search engines, and niche subreddits of every sort, it\u2019s easier than ever to \u201cfind your people\u201d\u2014whatever you want \u201cyour people\u201d to be.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The impulse isn\u2019t bad. To be human is to long for connection with other humans. And yet as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Find-Your-People-Building-Community\/dp\/0593193385\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">Jennie Allen\u2019s recent book<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yDVl3WHoymI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">Drew Holcomb\u2019s recent song<\/span><\/a> (both titled \u201cFind Your People\u201d) suggest, the longing is increasingly pronounced in a digital world more connected than ever but somehow simultaneously more isolating too.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Why is finding our people so hard today? Because we\u2019re looking in the wrong place. You\u2019ll find oodles of fans, \u201cfriends,\u201d followers, subscribers, and avatar interlocutors online. But most likely, you won\u2019t find \u201cyour people\u201d there. At least not the ones who will transform your life in positive and long-lasting ways.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Internet Community Can Be Great<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are positives to the possibilities of online community. For people coping with rare or chronic illnesses, it\u2019s never been easier to find communities of support and shared struggles where tips can be swapped and mutual encouragement offered. For trauma or abuse survivors, persecuted religious minorities, or other marginalized or vulnerable groups, finding community online can be a lifesaver.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even something like The Gospel Coalition likely wouldn\u2019t exist today were it not for the internet\u2019s knack for fostering connections and forming tribes (in this case connecting broadly Reformed people who share a certain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/about\/foundation-documents\/#theological-vision-for-ministry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">theological vision for ministry<\/span><\/a>). TGC is one of the millions of examples of nuanced and specific corners of the internet that sprung up once people could experience that \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Four-Loves-C-S-Lewis\/dp\/0062565397\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you too?<\/a>\u201d discovery of like-minded solidarity on a previously impossible scale.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The internet has allowed me to make connections with kindred spirits who became trusted friends\u2014people in other parts of the country or world whom I otherwise could never have known. Yet in each of these cases, what might have started online eventually led to an in-person, offline connection: meet-ups whenever possible, even if only once every couple of years when we\u2019re in the same city or at the same conference. This layer of embodied reality has been indispensable to the relationship\u2019s health long-term.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Physical Community Is Better<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">In spite of the benefits and affordances of online connection, I\u2019ve become increasingly convinced that <i>physical, proximate, in-the-flesh relationships<\/i> are far, far better for us. Screen life isn&#8217;t real life, and virtual relationships\u2014while beneficial in some ways\u2014are no substitute for incarnate relationships.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Consider the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psypost.org\/2022\/01\/massive-meta-analysis-finds-loneliness-has-increased-in-emerging-adults-in-the-last-43-years-62377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">rising rates of loneliness<\/span><\/a> in what some have called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/church-respond-loneliness-epidemic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">a loneliness epidemic<\/span><\/a>. In a world where it\u2019s so easy to find whatever people you want to find (online) or join whatever hyperspecific niche community suits your interests, why are people lonelier than ever?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Perhaps it\u2019s because the more human way to form a community isn&#8217;t around shared interests, in virtual reality, but around shared place, in physical reality. In relationships that help us grow, maybe <i>proximity<\/i> matters more than <i>affinity<\/i>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In relationships that help us grow, maybe proximity matters more than affinity.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">To be sure, proximate relationships are harder and more painful. It\u2019s much easier to go online for on-demand doses of relational connection, on your terms, with a bunch of contacts who will affirm you and give you the intoxicating experience of feeling &#8220;seen.&#8221; But feeling seen is different than <i>being<\/i> seen. And being seen is, in the end, less vital than being <i>known<\/i>. My contention is that local, in-the-flesh relationships, while potentially more of a headache, are where we can actually be known: embraced, prayed for, cared for, cried with, seen in the eyes, challenged face-to-face, received in the fullness of our fleshly fragility.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In good times, it\u2019s easy to feel like we don\u2019t really need in-person relationships. But in times of crisis, it becomes obvious we do. In times of pain and suffering, we can\u2019t feel the comforting embrace of a TikTok follower or pray on in the living room of a Facebook follower; our Instagram \u201cconnections\u201d offer little consolation beyond a passive heart to \u201clike\u201d our carefully constructed expressions of emotion. As Chris Martin observes in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Wolf-Their-Pockets-Internet-Threatens\/dp\/0802429513\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\">his new book on social media<\/a>, \u201cA retweet by a person on Twitter shouldn\u2019t be seen as the same as a shoulder to cry on. To see such things as equal is to have a fundamentally broken understanding of what it means to be friends with someone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While it\u2019s relatively easy to gain a social media following and call that \u201ccommunity,\u201d it\u2019s also easy to be rapidly misunderstood, misrepresented, and ultimately discarded by those followers. Online social dynamics are fickle and fragile\u2014and depending too much on them <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/gain-audience-lose-soul\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">erodes our integrity<\/a>. Better to surround yourself with trusted, committed friends offline than depend on the volatile mood of the digital masses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The more I work and live in a mostly online world, the more certain I am that my life\u2019s most important relationships are those grounded in physical proximity: People I can grab coffee with without getting on a plane. People I pray with in a living room or church sanctuary on a weekly basis. People who know me not just as a purveyor of \u201ccontent\u201d but chiefly as a person: red-headed husband; father; church elder; frequenter of Brot and Hidden House coffee shops; lover of hiking, gardening, good food, and going to the movies.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">5 Offline Places to Find Your People<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">In a manner similar to what the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Subsidiarity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">philosophy of subsidiarity<\/span><\/a> would suggest, relational bonds tend to be thickest and most life-giving when they&#8217;re most local and proximate. So look for \u201cyour people\u201d closer to home. Here are some places to start your search.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">1. Family<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Perhaps it\u2019s obvious, but your immediate family (or extended family who live nearby) represents the greatest potential for relational intimacy and longevity. The givenness of family frees us from the burden of choice: our parents or siblings or cousins might not be the people we\u2019d choose to do life with, but they&#8217;re the people we\u2019ve been given. And for better or worse, they tend to know us better than anyone else. They often feel most comfortable speaking hard truths to us and pulling us off the ledges of self-deception and unwise living. This makes family relationships painful at times but also invaluable.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">2. Local Church<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">The people the Holy Spirit gathers together in the <i>ecclesia<\/i> are often a hodgepodge assortment of ages, ethnicities, classes, and cultures. This is why it\u2019s such a rich place to forge family-like bonds. Similar to the unchosen givenness of blood family, a healthy church is an unchosen gift of unlikely brethren. Church relationships are powerful precisely because they\u2019re relationships we wouldn\u2019t <i>choose<\/i> with the algorithmic help of Google. Sometimes the people we most need in our life are the ones we don\u2019t know we need. But God knows. And by his grace, he places us in just the right church family\u2014one that will shape us profoundly if we\u2019re willing to set our consumer preferences aside and give our full selves to it.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">3. School or Work<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">The venues of school and work provide natural opportunities for developing meaningful relationships. These are people you see on a daily or weekly basis, with the potential of relationships spanning many years. The proximity of classmates or coworkers also means you can do human things together like engage in impromptu hallway or water cooler conversations (without having to schedule a phone call or Zoom chat), celebrate birthdays and other milestones, or converse over a lunch break. The stranger you sit by on the first day of class and the coworker whose cubicle happens to be next to yours aren&#8217;t people you choose based on personality compatibility inventories. But we do have the choice to get to know these strangers, not because they\u2019re like us but because they\u2019re next to us.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">4. Neighborhood<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">It used to go without saying, but the people who happen to live in your cul-de-sac or apartment complex can be an important part of your relationship circle. You don\u2019t choose them, but you\u2019ll need them. Whether it\u2019s the occasional egg you need while baking, a person to water your flowers when you\u2019re out of town, or (in my family\u2019s case) neighbors who can come over to babysit our kids on short notice, neighborhood relationships carry huge practical value. Beyond the practical, these are people who often minister to you relationally through front-yard or over-the-fence conversations, neighborhood social events, or small group studies. They\u2019re next door or down the street when you need them, and that matters.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">5. Third Spaces<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">I spend a lot of time in coffee shops. As a remote worker with no home office, the third spaces of local cafes are my daily sanctuary. I haven\u2019t met best friends in these places, but I&#8217;ve had memorable human interactions with people sitting across the table from me, and the baristas know me by name and ask about my family and work. If it&#8217;s not a coffee shop for you, maybe it\u2019s a Cheers-like neighborhood bar, a gym, a civic organization (e.g., Kiwanis Club or Rotary Club), or a members-only club. The people you rub shoulders with in these places sometimes align with you in interests or background, but often they\u2019re very different\u2014the sort of unexpected friendships we\u2019d never script for ourselves.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Supplement, Not Replacement<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Am I saying online relationships are always bad? No. Am I negating the experiences of people whose lives have been enhanced by totally virtual relationships? No. My life has been enriched by virtual relationships!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>They\u2019re next door or down the street when you need them, and that matters.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019m just suggesting that as people made by an intentional Creator to have bodies and to live in physical places, it\u2019s likely our most meaningful and reliable relationships will be embodied and proximate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Insofar as social media or digital technology helps supplement these embodied connections, facilitate offline connection (e.g., using social media to arrange meet-ups or advertise in-person events), or maintain relationships in seasons of physical distance (e.g., Skype or FaceTime), we can embrace their relational potential. But virtual connection should never replace embodied community. Our lonely cravings to \u201cfind our people\u201d will not be satisfied through screens.<\/p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>The past 30 years have provided something of a renaissance in the interpretation of Genesis 3:15, with many evangelical scholars providing sound exegetical and theological argumentation that this verse explicitly anticipates a future individual offspring of the woman. However, many scholars still strongly affirm the collective understanding of the seed of the woman.<\/p>\n<p>Another view proposes that the expectation of the seed of the woman is <em>both<\/em> individual and collective. In this interpretation, the verse anticipates (1) an individual coming Deliverer who will be at enmity with and exchange blows with the Serpent and (2) a collective group associated with the individual coming Deliverer who will participate in this enmity against the Serpent and his seed.<\/p>\n<p>Several New Testament passages allude to Genesis 3:15 and demonstrate a collective <em>and<\/em>\u00a0individual application of its outworking. Here are seven examples.<\/p>\n<h3>1. \u00a0Opponents of Jesus as Offspring of the Serpent<\/h3>\n<p>The Gospel accounts display an ongoing enmity: Jesus and his followers (seed of the woman) on one side and Satan and his agents (seed of the Serpent) on the other. On several occasions, Jesus identifies his opponents as children or offspring of the Devil. In attributing their spiritual parentage to the Devil, Jesus declares his opponents are thinking and acting like the Devil.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus directly addresses the Pharisees as \u201cserpents\u201d and a \u201cbrood of vipers\u201d (Matt. 23:33; cf. 3:7; Luke 3:7). A Jew identifying someone as the offspring of a serpent is, in view of the broader context of the Old Testament, quite possibly alluding to Genesis 3:15 to some degree. These statements don\u2019t necessarily address whether the seed of the woman is individual or collective, but they do suggest Jesus understands his opponents to be representative of the offspring of the Serpent.<\/p>\n<p>In John 8, Jesus identifies the Jewish religious leaders with the offspring of the Serpent in his heated dialogue with \u201cthe Jews\u201d (also identified as the Pharisees in v. 13) who insist they\u2019re the offspring (\u03c3\u03c0\u1f73\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1) of Abraham (vv. 33, 39). Though Jesus concedes these \u201cJews\u201d are offspring of Abraham in a physical sense (v. 37), they\u2019re not truly \u201cAbraham\u2019s children\u201d (\u03c4\u1f73\u03ba\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f08\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u1f71\u03bc) because they don\u2019t do \u201cthe works Abraham did\u201d (v. 39).<\/p>\n<p>True offspring of Abraham wouldn\u2019t seek to kill Jesus, a man who speaks God\u2019s truth (vv. 37, 40). Furthermore, God cannot be their father (v. 41) since they\u2019re rejecting Jesus, the One whom God had sent (v. 42). Instead, the Devil is their father, since they fulfill his desires in their opposition to Jesus (v. 44).<\/p>\n<p>Jesus points out the two primary sins of the Devil that solidifies their connection to him: he was a \u201cmurderer from the beginning,\u201d and he is \u201ca liar and the father of lies\u201d (v. 44). The Jews\u2019 intent to murder Jesus (vv. 37, 40, 44, 59), their rejection of his truth (vv. 37, 43\u201347), and their propagation of lies (vv. 41, 48, 52) demonstrate their character reflects the character of the Devil. The Devil, then, is their spiritual father, and they\u2019re his offspring.<\/p>\n<p>Because Jesus is certainly alluding to the Serpent\u2019s actions in Genesis 3 in identifying the Devil as a liar and a murderer, he\u2019s likely thinking of that chapter in referring to the unbelieving Jews as children of the Devil\u2014the offspring of the Serpent.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Enmity&#8221; describes Jesus\u2019s relationship with such offspring of the Serpent. When Jesus confronts the offspring of the Serpent, he doesn\u2019t come peaceably; rather, he engages in a harsh war of words in which he identifies and overcomes the agents of Satan.<\/p>\n<p>This enmity doesn\u2019t end with the Serpent\u2019s seed\u2019s rejection of Jesus; it continues with the offspring of the Serpent persecuting, flogging, killing, and crucifying Jesus\u2019s messengers (Matt. 23:34\u201335). If these entities are representative of the offspring of the Serpent and if they\u2019re at enmity with the individual Messiah, then these references appear to support the idea of the individual offspring of the woman being fulfilled in Jesus. Jesus presents these as enemies not only of himself but also of his followers. Therefore, throughout Jesus\u2019s ministry, the offspring of the Serpent are at enmity with Jesus and his followers.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Throughout Jesus\u2019s ministry, the offspring of the Serpent are at enmity with Jesus and his followers.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Though Jesus\u2019s followers aren\u2019t specifically identified as \u201coffspring of the woman,\u201d their position of enmity with the offspring of the Serpent assumes this identification. It isn\u2019t necessary for Jesus to say, \u201cYou, my disciples, are offspring of the woman\u201d in order to understand that the theme of enmity promised in Genesis 3:15 is being displayed in the Gospels. These conflicts support the idea of enmity between both individual and collective offspring.<\/p>\n<h3>2. \u00a0John\u2019s Theology of the World (Gospel of John)<\/h3>\n<p>John\u2019s theology of the world also reflects the individual and collective enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the Serpent. John presents Satan as the ruler of the world (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11; 1 John 5:19), who works in direct opposition to Jesus. The \u201cworld\u201d in this sense in John refers not to the created universe but to the sinful people and the systems that stem from those sinful people (and from their ruler, the Devil).<\/p>\n<p>John positions the world in direct opposition to Jesus. Not only does the world hate Jesus (John 7:7; 15:18\u201324), but the world also hates believers\u2014those who follow Jesus (John 15:18\u201324; 17:14; 1 John 3:13).<\/p>\n<p>If Satan is identified as the Serpent from Genesis 3, and those who follow after him are identified as his \u201cseed\u201d or his children (or \u201cthe world\u201d), then it seems consistent to understand John\u2019s theology of the world as unfolding the concepts presented in Genesis 3. Satan and the world persist in their enmity toward Jesus and believers. The world \u201chates\u201d Jesus and his people. Satan and the sinful leaders of this world put Jesus to death (striking his heel), but Jesus ultimately is victorious over the Devil (striking his head) and overcomes the world (John 16:33). Christians participate in this victory as they also overcome the world (1 John 2:13\u201314; 4:4; 5:4\u20135).<\/p>\n<p>Though John doesn\u2019t specifically identify believers as \u201coffspring of the woman,\u201d he clearly states they\u2019re at enmity with the Devil and those who follow the Devil. To say Satan and his \u201cchildren\u201d are at enmity with God\u2019s people is to identify God\u2019s people as the offspring of the woman who are at enmity with the Serpent\u2019s seed.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Parable of the Weeds (Matt. 13:25\u201328)<\/h3>\n<p>The parable of the weeds (or tares) among the wheat provides a subtle allusion to Genesis 3:15. In this parable, an \u201cenemy\u201d comes and sows weeds among good seed (Matt. 13:25\u201328). Jesus is the One who had sown the good seed (identified as the \u201csons of the kingdom,\u201d v. 38), and the Devil is the Enemy who sows the weeds in an effort \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Matthew-Zondervan-Exegetical-Commentary-Testament\/dp\/0310243572\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sabotage the harvest<\/a>.\u201d The weeds themselves are \u201cthe sons of the evil one\u201d (i.e., seed of the Serpent, v. 38).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Jesus ultimately is victorious over the Devil (striking his head) and overcomes the world. Christians participate in this victory as they also overcome the world.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Because the weeds are so intermingled with the wheat, they must grow together until the judgment. The sons of the Evil One cause sin (\u03c3\u03ba\u1f71\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd), a phrase which likely refers to people who lead others into sin. The point is that Satan seeks to perpetuate the existence of sons of the Evil One in the world to oppose God\u2019s redemptive purposes.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s striking that this parable presents the same key entities present in Genesis 3:15: the Son of Man (Matt. 13:37), the \u201csons of the kingdom\u201d (v. 38), the \u201csons of the evil one\u201d (v. 38), and the Devil (v. 39). Furthermore, the two heads of the group (the Son of Man and the Devil) are opposing each other, and the two groups who follow the heads are both identified as a type of \u201cseed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the end, the seed of the Devil will be judged. In relation to Genesis 3:15, it may also be noteworthy that the Devil is identified as \u201can enemy\u201d (Matt. 13:28, 39; \u1f10\u03c7\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \/ \u05d0\u05b9\u05d9\u05b5\u05d1), which reflects the language of \u201cenmity\u201d in Genesis (\u1f14\u03c7\u03b8\u03c1\u03b1 \/ \u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4). Though the \u201cseed\u201d in the parable is obviously an agricultural reference, the use of the term in addition to the other key themes in this section seems to present a strong allusion to Genesis 3:15.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Children of God and Children of the Devil (1 John 3:8\u201313)<\/h3>\n<p>In 1 John 3, John clearly has the early chapters of Genesis on his mind. He speaks of the Devil who \u201chas been sinning from the beginning\u201d (3:8), and then he moves to a discussion of Cain, who murdered his brother (vv. 11\u201313).<\/p>\n<p>John says, \u201cThe reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the Devil\u201d (v. 8). This statement should certainly be understood to refer to the individual seed of the woman who will crush the head of the Serpent. John then proceeds to contrast two different collective groups\u2014the children of God and the children of the Devil (v. 10). The children of God are born of God, and they don\u2019t make a practice of sinning; the children of the Devil are the ones who don\u2019t practice righteousness.<\/p>\n<p>John, therefore, presents the same entities spoken of in Genesis 3:15: (1) the Son of God, who destroys the works of (2) the Devil, (3) the children of God, in whom God\u2019s seed abides, and (4) the children of the Devil. The allusion to Genesis seems clear, based on the presence of these entities placed in antithesis to each other, with one side ultimately being victorious over the other.<\/p>\n<p>It would be exegetically naive <em>not<\/em> to see an allusion to Genesis in these statements. Jesus clearly represents the seed of the woman who\u2019s crushing the Serpent, and his children are clearly set in opposition to the children of the Serpent. If John is describing the outworking of Genesis 3:15, then he appears to understand the seed of the woman in that verse in both an individual and a collective sense.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Crushing Satan Under Your Feet (Rom. 16:20)<\/h3>\n<p>Most interpreters acknowledge an allusion to Genesis in Romans 16:20, although the language of Paul\u2019s promise isn\u2019t the same as the language in Genesis. The LXX rendering of \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05e3 as \u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u1f73\u03c9 in Genesis 3:15 is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Romans-Baker-Exegetical-Commentary-Testament\/dp\/1540960056\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">known to be problematic<\/a>. Therefore, it seems likely Paul chose a Greek word that would more accurately translate \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05e3: \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u1f77\u03b2\u03c9, which means \u201cto crush.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the context, Paul seems to be representing the heretics in Romans 16:17 as agents of Satan, an idea supported by other Pauline statements identifying false teachers as agents of Satan (e.g., 2 Cor. 11:14\u201315). In this sense, these two collective groups are at enmity with each other. It\u2019s noteworthy in Romans 16:20 that both an individual (the God of peace) and a collective group (the church) are involved in crushing Satan, though the key actor in the victory is God.<\/p>\n<p>If Romans 16:20 is an allusion to Genesis 3:15, which seems probable, then it\u2019s presenting both an individual and a collective understanding of the identity of the seed of the woman.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Seed and Seeds (Gal. 3:15\u201329)<\/h3>\n<p>Galatians 3 doesn\u2019t contain a direct allusion to Genesis 3:15, but it\u2019s relevant in a discussion of whether the seed is individual and\/or collective.<\/p>\n<p>In the same contextual section of Galatians, Paul clearly uses \u201coffspring\u201d (\u03c3\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1) for an individual, \u201creferring to one, . . . who is Christ\u201d (3:16), as well as for the collective group of the Galatian believers: \u201cYou [plural] are Abraham\u2019s offspring\u201d (v. 29).<\/p>\n<p>It seems best to see the reference to the individual offspring in Galatians 3:16 as \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/sbts-wordpress-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/equip\/uploads\/2010\/10\/sbjt-v14-n3_deroache_meyer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an exegetically grounded interpretation<\/a> of Gen 17:8 (and\/or 13:15; 24:7) within its broader literary context, especially 3:15 and 22:17\u201318.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The existence of the collective offspring depends ultimately on the work of the individual offspring, Christ. Thus, based on his reading of key passages in Genesis, Paul interprets the Abrahamic promises with the expectation of both an individual, Jesus the Messiah, and a collective group, the people of God, as \u201coffspring.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>7. Cosmic Drama (Rev. 12)<\/h3>\n<p>Revelation 12\u201313 describes the outworking of Genesis 3:15 so vividly that it may be said to represent a \u201cmidrash on Genesis 3:15.\u201d Paul S. Minear <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/1561198\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">argues<\/a> \u201cit is Genesis 3:15\u201320 that dominates the whole of Revelation 12.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The existence of the collective offspring depends ultimately on the work of the individual offspring, Christ.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The same four entities from Genesis are active in these two chapters in Revelation, in which the individual offspring of the woman wounds the head of the dragon (13:3). \u201cThe dragon and his angels\u201d engage in this conflict, representing the offspring of the Serpent (12:7\u201310), and they&#8217;re waging war with the collective offspring of the woman, identified as \u201cthe rest of her offspring\u201d (v. 17).<\/p>\n<p>In Revelation 12, a \u201cwoman clothed with the sun\u201d gives birth to the Messiah, at whose birth the dragon unsuccessfully attempts to devour him (vv. 1\u20135). Upon the Messiah\u2019s ascent to heaven, war arises in heaven, and Michael and his angels defeat \u201cthe dragon and his angels,\u201d who are thrown down to the earth (12:7\u20139). This dragon, identified as \u201cthe Devil\u201d in verse 12, pursues the woman and then goes \u201cto make war on the rest of her offspring [\u03c3\u03c0\u1f73\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1], on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus\u201d (v. 17).<\/p>\n<p>In a context that clearly describes the outworking of Genesis 3:15, a reference to a collective group of godly people as \u201cthe rest of her offspring\u201d certainly supports the idea of an expected collective offspring of the woman. G. K. Beale and Sean M. McDonough <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Commentary-New-Testament-Use-Old\/dp\/0801026938\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comment<\/a>, \u201cSuch a contrast between individual and corporate seeds is supported by the fact that 12:17 is an allusion to Gen. 3:16, where John would have seen that Eve\u2019s messianic seed has both individual and corporate meaning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The two beasts aim to carry out the dragon\u2019s work \u201cto make war on the saints and to conquer them\u201d (Rev. 13:7) for 42 months (vv. 1\u201318). If Genesis 3:15 is the basis for this text, then the collective groups on both sides seem to be engaged in the outworking of the promised enmity.<\/p>\n<p>One critical point in Revelation 13 is that the head of one of the beasts \u201cseemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed\u201d (v. 3). Beale <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Revelation-International-Greek-Testament-Commentary\/dp\/080282174X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">notes<\/a> that \u201csuch a wound on the head of the grand nemesis of God\u2019s people reflects Gen. 3:15, especially when seen together with Rev. 12:17.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In spite of the apparent victory of the beast, who is \u201callowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them\u201d (13:7), the saints are ultimately victorious over the beast (15:2). When the beast kills the martyrs, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Theology-Book-Revelation-New-Testament\/dp\/0521356911\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the beast\u2019s apparent victory<\/a> is the martyrs\u2019\u2014and therefore God\u2019s\u2014real victory.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bauckham <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Theology-Book-Revelation-New-Testament\/dp\/0521356911\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">explains<\/a>, \u201cThe point is not that the beast and the Christians each win some victories; rather, the same event\u2014the martyrdom of Christians\u2014is described both as the beast\u2019s victory over them and as their victory over the beast.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In this way, the victory of the saints over the beast follows the pattern of the victory of Christ over Satan\u2014Satan appears to be victorious at Jesus\u2019s death, but Jesus\u2019s death (and resurrection) is actually the critical event in his victory over Satan. And this reflects the fullest sense of the promise from Genesis 3:15, that the Serpent would strike the offspring of the woman but the offspring of the woman would emerge as the ultimate victor. The individual offspring of the woman, the One sitting on the white horse, accompanied by his army, defeats the armies of the beast and his prophet (19:11\u201320).<\/p>\n<p>Though it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how the original readers of Genesis would have identified the offspring of the woman, the fuller revelation of the canon of Scripture seems to draw attention to a fulfillment in both an individual and collective offspring.<\/p>\n",

The key words and concepts from Genesis 3:15 recur in numerous instances in the Old and New Testaments, which support the idea that the offspring of the woman should be understood both as an individual and as a collective group. Cheek surveys the key arguments for each view and presents four arguments in support of the idea that the intent of Genesis 3:15 is to speak of a collective offspring of the woman in addition to an individual offspring.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.

Taking Exodus 30:11\u201316 as the starting point, Himes argues that David was supposed to take the census and that, as with the situation with the Gibeonites in 2 Samuel 21, David\u2019s role was meant to be that of one who atones for the nation\u2019s sins, turning away God\u2019s wrath. The final section answers potential objections such as the role of Joab.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Greg Palys <\/strong><strong>| <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/themelios\/article\/christs-surpassing-glory\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Christ\u2019s Surpassing Glory: An Argument for the \u201cInappropriateness\u201d of OT Christophanies from Exodus 33\u201334 and 2 Corinthians 3:7\u20134:6<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Did the preincarnate Christ reveal himself in the Old Testament? Many believe that visible manifestations of God in the Old Testament must be manifestations of the Son. Surely if this is true, then we would be able to identify Christ most clearly in the Old Testament\u2019s grandest manifestations of God\u2019s glory. However, Paul\u2019s reflection on the Sinai theophany identifies that which was revealed to Moses as a lesser glory, one we cannot equate with Christ\u2019s surpassing glory. If Christ\u2019s greater glory was inappropriate for the Sinai theophany, then it follows that all other lesser \u201cChristophanies\u201d would be equally inappropriate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6.

Montgomery argues that \u201csalt of the earth\u201d is to be read as the church\u2019s calling to participate in the flavor of the redemptive kingdom of heaven and by extension to invite those outside to share in the feast of the new creation reality. This reading interprets the metonymic \u201csalt\u201d saying in light of the new temple theme in the Sermon on the Mount.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Hallur Mortensen <\/strong><strong>| <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/themelios\/article\/seeing-is-not-believing-apocalyptic-epistemology-and-faith-in-the-son-of-god-in-marks-gospel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Seeing Is Not Believing: Apocalyptic Epistemology and Faith in the Son of God in Mark\u2019s Gospel<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Following recent discussions on the nature of the apocalyptic, Mortensen argues that it primarily has to do with revelation of hidden things. This means that at the core of the apocalyptic is epistemology, and it\u2019s thus argued the Gospel of Mark is apocalyptic essentially in its epistemology rather than eschatology. Mark\u2019s parable theory, and hence the responses to Jesus, are examined in this light. The question as to why some respond in faith in Jesus as the Son of God while others respond with fear, hardness of heart, and unbelief is answered by Mark\u2019s apocalyptic epistemology: Jesus\u2019s divine sonship must be revealed in order to be believed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. David Shaw <\/strong><strong>| <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/themelios\/article\/the-eagle-has-landed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The Eagle Has Landed: 3 John and Its Theological Vision for Pastoral Ministry<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Shaw argues that when 3 John is read in light of John\u2019s Gospel, it can be seen to have rich theological foundations and to offer a vision for ministry that\u2019s the natural and fitting trajectory of the Gospel. These are especially evident in 3 John\u2019s depiction of the ministry of individuals, the conflict their ministry provokes, their practice of hospitality, their rejection of self-love, and the pattern of imitation in the life of the church.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. Jared M. August <\/strong><strong>| <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/themelios\/article\/what-shall-we-remember-the-eternality-of-memory-in-revelation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>What Shall We Remember? The Eternality of Memory in Revelation<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>August considers the concept of the eternality of human memory and what the Christian may expect to remember after death. Although numerous resources address the topic of the resurrected life, few consider the Bible\u2019s teaching on the permanence of memory. By considering key passages from the book of Revelation, this study attempts a brief overview of the topic. August proposes that Revelation depicts the believer\u2019s eternal memory as detailed, correspondent to objective reality, experienced communally, and healable by God.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. Randall K. Johnson <\/strong><strong>|<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/themelios\/article\/christological-arguments-for-compatibilism-in-reformed-theology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Christological Arguments for Compatibilism in Reformed Theology<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Christian compatibilists believe human freedom and moral responsibility are compatible with theological determinism\u2014that is, a robust account of divine sovereignty. Whereas most arguments for compatibilism stem from considerations about divine providence, human nature, or sin, we ought not to neglect christological arguments. Johnson presents the christological arguments for compatibilism from three prominent theologians in the Reformed tradition: John Calvin, Francis Turretin, and Jonathan Edwards. He concludes with some reflections on the power of christological arguments for compatibilism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>11. Stephen Estes <\/strong><strong>| <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/themelios\/article\/christ-for-us-bonhoeffers-christology-and-ethic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christ for Us: An Analysis of Bonhoeffer\u2019s Christology and Its Implications for His Ethic<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This study analyzes the Christology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the famous German theologian who stood against evil in a day when his contemporaries failed. Estes traces the outline of Christology, including its dual emphasis on the transcendence and the immanence of God in Christ. Along the way, he also contrasts Bonhoeffer\u2019s theology with popular theologies of his day, including those who used the \u201cOrders of Creation\u201d as a theological defense of Nazism and those within the Confessing Church who resisted but nonetheless didn\u2019t recognize the importance of standing with the Jews in their persecution. He concludes that Bonhoeffer\u2019s exceptional ethic was the natural outworking of his robust Christology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>12. Nathan D. Shannon <\/strong><strong>| <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/themelios\/article\/genealogy-and-doctrine-reformed-and-confucian-sociologies-of-knowledge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Genealogy and Doctrine: Reformed and Confucian Sociologies of Knowledge<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This article presents comparative textual analyses toward a basic grammar for understanding the interface between Reformed and Confucian sociologies of knowledge. Shannon first proposes a three-part Reformed theology of theological tradition in terms of historically successive communities. He then presents relevant material from the <em>Analects<\/em> of Confucius, focusing on Confucius\u2019s own sociology of learning and instruction. Striking similarities between these two models come to light, as well as significant differences in the areas of unity and truth, ontology and office, and sin and grace.<\/p>\n<p><strong>13. Kevin DeYoung <\/strong><strong>| <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/themelios\/article\/the-case-for-christian-nationalism-a-review-article\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>The Case for Christian Nationalism<\/em>: A Review Article<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For all the fine retrieval work Stephen Wolfe does in parts of <em>The Case for Christian Nationalism<\/em>, the overall project must be rejected. DeYoung offers a substantive critique of this book under four headings: nations and ethnicity, the nature of the church, Protestant political thought, and the way forward. While it&#8217;s right to pray for a great renewal, we must remember that the most needed renewal in our world and in our land is the restoration of true doctrine, the reformation of our lives, and the revival of that divine and supernatural light shining in our hearts to show us God\u2019s glory in the face of Christ (2 Cor. 4:6).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Featured Book Reviews:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alan J.

      "rendered": "<p>In AD 597, the bishop of Rome sent a missionary named Augustine to evangelize the Anglo people of southern England. Augustine\u2019s mission base became known as the See of Canterbury, his office the Seat of Canterbury, and the global church that grew from it the Anglican Communion. There are now around 85 million Christians who are part of the Anglican tradition, making the Communion the third-largest Christian denomination in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, the Anglican Communion is in crisis. Across the world, many Anglican bishops, pastors, and institutions have turned from the authority of Scripture and rebelled against both biblical teaching and church doctrine\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/faqs-anglican-same-sex-marriage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">especially in matters of human sexuality<\/a>. The most recent example is the vote by the general synod of the Church of England to allow pastors to bless <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/anglican-communion-blessing-same-sex-marriages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same-sex unions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Those of us who gathered last week in Kigali, Rwanda, for <a href=\"https:\/\/gafcon23.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the fourth Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON IV)<\/a> are believing and praying this crisis is the birth pains of a renewed Communion, not its death throes.<\/p>\n<p>I grew up in the Anglican Church, was ordained there, and now pastor one of its congregations. What happens to the Anglican Communion certainly matters to me and my congregation. It also matters to the broader church. Here&#8217;s what I experienced at GAFCON IV and what all believers can learn from global Anglicans in this important moment.<\/p>\n<h3>Resetting a Global Communion<\/h3>\n<p>From April 17\u201321, 1,302 delegates from 52 countries\u2014including 315 bishops, 456 members of the clergy, and 531 laypeople\u2014gathered in Kigali for GAFCON IV. These leaders attended on behalf of 85 percent of worldwide Anglicans.<\/p>\n<p>Launched in Jerusalem in 2008, GAFCON stands as a response to the crisis in our Communion. Its goal is to offer a biblical counter to progressive Anglicans\u2019 errors in doctrine and practice and a spiritual home for the faithful.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_552452\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-552452\" style=\"width: 1920px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-552452 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24113807\/GAFCON-2008-in-Jerusalem_Bishops_IMG_0893-1920x880.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24113807\/GAFCON-2008-in-Jerusalem_Bishops_IMG_0893-1920x880.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24113807\/GAFCON-2008-in-Jerusalem_Bishops_IMG_0893-300x138.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24113807\/GAFCON-2008-in-Jerusalem_Bishops_IMG_0893-768x352.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-552452\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bishops gathered at the first GAFCON meeting in Jerusalem in 2008<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Foley Beach, the archbishop of the Anglican Church in North America and former chairman of GAFCON, said in his opening address that it&#8217;s \u201ctime to move on past Canterbury.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gafcon.org\/news\/gafcon-iv-the-kigali-commitment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Kigali Commitment<\/a>, released on the final day of the conference, affirms this judgment and calls the current archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, to repent: &#8220;Despite 25 years of persistent warnings by most Anglican Primates, repeated departures from the authority of God\u2019s Word have torn the fabric of the Communion.

It needs an adequate and robust foundation that addresses the legal and constitutional complexities in various Provinces. The goal is that orthodox Anglicans worldwide will have a clear identity, a global &#8220;spiritual home&#8221; of which they can be proud, and a strong leadership structure that gives them stability and direction as Global Anglicans.<\/p>\n<h3>Lessons from GAFCON IV<\/h3>\n<p>What can we learn from this tragic but ultimately hopeful moment in the Anglican Communion?<\/p>\n<h4>1. Faithfulness to God\u2019s Son is inseparable from faithfulness to his Word.<\/h4>\n<p>Listening to theologically liberal Anglicans can be confusing. They speak of loving Jesus, hearing Christ speak in Scripture, and commitment to Christ\u2019s mission\u2014all things an attendee at GAFCON would also affirm. But listen longer and the tune changes: Jesus, Scripture, and God\u2019s mission are shaped in the image of the liberal Anglicans and their ideologies, rather than those leaders being shaped by God\u2019s Word.<\/p>\n<p>The decisive issue for Anglicans today is the same as during the Reformation: the authority of the Bible and its plain interpretation. The Bible doesn\u2019t sit below or alongside human reason and tradition. It isn\u2019t interpreted like a piece of modern art\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/themelios\/review\/is-there-a-meaning-in-this-text-the-bible-the-reader-and-the-morality-of-literary-knowledge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">so that meaning lies in the experience of the reader<\/a>. Rather, as the Kigali Commitment states,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The Bible is God\u2019s Word written, breathed out by God as it was written by his faithful messengers (2 Timothy 3:16). It carries God\u2019s own authority, is its own interpreter, and it does not need to be supplemented, nor can it ever be overturned by human wisdom. God\u2019s good Word is the rule of our lives as disciples of Jesus and is the final authority in the church. It grounds, energises and directs our mission in the world. The fellowship we enjoy with our risen and ascended Lord is nourished as we trust God\u2019s Word, obey it and encourage each other to allow it to shape each area of our lives. This fellowship is broken when we turn aside from God\u2019s Word or attempt to reinterpret it in any way that overturns the plain reading of the text in its canonical context and so deny its truthfulness, clarity, sufficiency, and thereby its authority.<\/p>\n<p>We must have this clarity. Knowing Christ and faithfulness to him are inseparable from submitting to \u201cthe plain reading of the [Bible\u2019s] text in its canonical context.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>2. A healthy church needs strong leadership.<\/h4>\n<p>The archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s equivocation, and now outright dissent, from Christian teaching stands in stark contrast to the clear and courageous leadership of the men who have led the GAFCON movement. Peter Jensen, Peter Akinola, Ben Kwashi, Foley Beach, and others have sacrificed much to shepherd God\u2019s flock toward good pasture.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The decisive issue for Anglicans today is the same as during the Reformation: the authority of the Bible and its plain interpretation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>GAFCON IV reminds us God has structured the church by giving it pastors and shepherds (Eph. 4:11). These leaders are qualified by two attributes: godly character and rightly handling God\u2019s Word (Titus 2:7; 1 Tim. 3:2\u20137). For their stewardship of this high calling, they\u2019ll be judged strictly (James 3:1).<\/p>\n<p>The failure of the Anglican Communion has been a failure of its leaders. Watching this failure and the response of godly men reminds pastors and teachers that we must tremble before our calling. It should remind church members of the need to pray regularly for their shepherds.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Local discipleship benefits from global Christianity.<\/h4>\n<p>Humans are social creations, and our discipleship is shaped by our context. While in Kigali, I listened to and prayed with Christians from Myanmar, Nigeria, northern Sudan, Australia, Rwanda, and the United Kingdom. They revealed some blind spots in my own discipleship ministry.<\/p>\n<p>Two pastors from Africa reminded me it\u2019s neither unexpected nor unusual for the Bible\u2019s sexual ethic to sit awkwardly within a culture. For over a century, churches in parts of Africa have faced the complexity of bringing the Bible\u2019s teaching about monogamous marriage into settings where polygamy was normal. Those of us in the West should remember that tension between a biblical sexual ethic and the surrounding culture is to be expected, not seen as a reason to jettison the faith (Acts 15:20; 1 Cor. 6:9).<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_552457\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-552457\" style=\"width: 1920px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-552457 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24114303\/Sam-with-Gafcon-Small-Group-1920x1440.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24114303\/Sam-with-Gafcon-Small-Group-1920x1440.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24114303\/Sam-with-Gafcon-Small-Group-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24114303\/Sam-with-Gafcon-Small-Group-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24114303\/Sam-with-Gafcon-Small-Group-1376x1032.jpg 1376w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24114303\/Sam-with-Gafcon-Small-Group-1044x783.jpg 1044w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24114303\/Sam-with-Gafcon-Small-Group-632x474.jpg 632w, https:\/\/media.thegospelcoalition.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/24114303\/Sam-with-Gafcon-Small-Group-536x402.jpg 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-552457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Ferguson (back right) with his small group at GAFCON IV<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>A Sudanese convert from Islam to Christianity reminded me that local churches aren\u2019t for entertainment but are meant to be family. This brother shared how his Muslim family held his funeral when he converted, going so far as to bury an empty casket in a tomb that bore his name. Our local churches must be family, especially for those who will lose their families to follow Jesus in an increasingly hostile culture.<\/p>\n<p>Anglicanism is a historic branch of Christianity. For it to thrive in the future as a global movement will mean cultivating godly leaders who are faithful to God\u2019s Word. During a memorable testimony at GAFCON IV, one Sudanese Anglican reminded us that will be costly: \u201cA Christianity that costs us nothing is not biblical.\u201d As I reflect on my time at GAFCON IV, I\u2019d add, \u201cA church that costs its members nothing is not the church for which Christ died.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Though it\u2019s costly, I pray faithful Anglicans will continue to do the hard work of humble gospel reform, ongoing repentance, and structural resetting that our Communion so desperately needs.<\/p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>At what point should a person be paid for ministry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a great question to be asked by both sides\u2014by those who would pay and those who would be paid.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose we saw somebody with the best training\u2014taught directly by the resurrected Jesus\u2014whose work experience included planting churches and training leadership, whose skills include supernatural powers to heal, and whose writing was inspired by God. What if that person also oversaw the health of many churches in the region, provided mentorship and guidance to the church leaders, and bore the cost of difficult decisions through shipwrecks, beatings, and imprisonment?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, we&#8217;re talking about the apostle Paul, who according to the economics of today should be the highest-paid minister in history. But the witness of the Bible is that Paul consistently supported himself in his own ministry.<\/p>\n<h3>Conflicting Commands?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s perhaps surprising is that Paul consistently argued ministers <em>deserve<\/em> pay even as he personally ministered free of charge. Paul\u2014along with the rest of the Bible\u2014simultaneously affirms that ministers deserve pay and yet that ministers ought to serve free of charge.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider when Jesus sends out the disciples to proclaim the gospel. He tells them first, \u201cYou received without paying; give without pay\u201d (Matt. 10:8). But he also tells them not to bring supplies with them because they should expect support. After all, \u201cthe laborer deserves his food\u201d (10:10). Paul twice argues that \u201cyou shall not muzzle the ox\u201d and \u201cthe worker deserves his wages\u201d (1 Tim. 5; 1 Cor. 9) to explain that elders who rule and teach, as well as apostles who are sent on missions, deserve financial support. Soldiers don&#8217;t serve at their own expense, and those who plant enjoy the fruit (1 Cor. 9:7\u201310).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Paul\u2014along with the rest of the Bible\u2014simultaneously affirms that ministers deserve pay and yet that ministers ought to serve free of charge.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Paul sees working free of charge as an example that others ought to follow. He tells the Thessalonians that, while he had the right to financial support, he worked physical labor to support himself to give the church &#8220;an example to imitate\u201d (2 Thess. 3:9). Paul famously made tents with Priscilla and Aquila to support himself while he ministered in Corinth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s an important asymmetry here. Paul exhorts churches to support their elders, but he exhorts all Christians to emulate him in serving free of charge. These conflicting commands mean that, in any particular instance, determining whether somebody should be paid for ministry requires wisdom and should reflect the context of the situation. No single answer applies across circumstances.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, whether a particular role should be paid in a small-town, rural church with a small staff and small budget may be different from the answer for a large church with full-time professional staff and an ample budget.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, there are a couple of questions all institutions and individuals can ask as they approach their own situations.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Who is burdened?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paul tells the Thessalonians that his motivation was to not burden them, and he tells the Corinthians he didn&#8217;t want to put up any obstacle. Paul worked without pay because receiving assistance would&#8217;ve burdened the church or provided an obstacle to growth. At the same time, the metaphor of a soldier serving at his own expense means the minister, too, ought not to be burdened.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a church will be burdened by financially supporting a minister, and if the minister would <em>not<\/em> be burdened by supporting himself, then it would be wise to minister free of charge. Even in this case, the minister still deserves honor and to enjoy the fruit of his labor, which might mean nonfinancial forms of recognition, appreciation, or support.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the reverse could also be true. The minister may be burdened by serving free of charge.\u00a0If he&#8217;s serving full-time as a way to support his family, he should certainly receive a fair wage. Even if he&#8217;s not,\u00a0ministry of all kinds can be incredibly taxing emotionally and on one\u2019s family. If a church can alleviate financial burdens, they ought to endeavor to do so.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burdens need not only be financial. In some contexts, paying people can endow the ministry with credibility. But it may also cause resentment or a lessening of enthusiasm from volunteers who are also serving without pay. Churches should exercise wisdom in determining whether paying somebody for his work would benefit the work itself.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Does pay encourage greed and materialism?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in one of the most materialistic societies in history, so we ought to always be on guard against greed. As ministers, we need to ask ourselves if we <em>need<\/em> the pay to relieve burdens or simply <em>want<\/em> it. As institutions, we need to ask ourselves if we&#8217;re withholding pay when we could afford to give it. What&#8217;s in the budget that takes away from supporting your people?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greed could manifest, for example, in a small church in which congregants begrudge giving the pastor a raise when they don\u2019t get raises themselves, or when they resent that the pastor earns more than they do. But greed and materialism could also be reflected by paying a pastor too <em>much<\/em>, such as in a flashy church that boasts of having a hip, well-paid pastor with expensive sneakers and cool clothes. Paul encountered this issue in Corinth. The congregation faulted Paul because he did <em>not<\/em> burden them and wasn\u2019t as flashy as the so-called super-apostles (2 Cor. 12).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a greedy culture, we should be particularly attentive to the possibility that working free of charge will not only serve the church but also establish witness, just as Paul notes.<\/p>\n<h3>Be Generous<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should endeavor to be generous on both sides. Churches, endeavor as much as you can to provide for those who serve among you. Servants, endeavor as much as you can to serve without burdening those you serve.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the rewards for our labor come from the God who gives generously based on his desire to bless us, not based on the work we\u2019ve done (Matt. 20). As we seek to bless those who labor among us and to offer the gospel free of charge without burdening others, we can have faith that, ultimately, God will provide our every need.<\/p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>We were on the road, driving our oldest son home from his freshman year in college, when the moment of clarity hit.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMom, I\u2019ve been in bed for the past week,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave my dorm room. I didn\u2019t finish my classes. That video game did something to me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll never forget the shock I felt. <i>What do you mean, \u201cThat game did something to me\u201d?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>At that moment, six years of conflict suddenly made sense. I finally realized: our son was trapped in his virtual world and couldn&#8217;t get out.<\/p>\n<h3>Problem<\/h3>\n<p>I should have noticed the warning signs in middle school when Adam started dropping out of sports and hobbies to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/gaming-alone\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">play more video games<\/a>. He also began choosing his gaming world over spending time with us or going to church. I hated my new job as the Game Cop Mom, setting the kitchen timer and dealing with constant conflicts over his game time.<\/p>\n<p>Was it normal for a teen boy to be happily hunched over a screen in the dark basement for hours? My mom friends assured me, \u201cAt least he&#8217;s not out getting into trouble. At least you always know where he is.\u201d I remember thinking this was setting a low bar. But he was my first child, and he seemed to be learning so much on that screen\u2014at least, that\u2019s what he told me.<\/p>\n<p>His screen habits grew worse in ninth grade when his school, like many others, issued a laptop to all the students. That was a turning point for our family because we lost all ability to help him manage his screen time. As I walked down the school hall one day to meet the counselor to discuss the problem, I passed a row of boys, all playing <i>Call of Duty<\/i> on their school-issued laptops. I wondered how other parents were coping.<\/p>\n<p>The remainder of Adam\u2019s time in high school was filled with conflict\u2014the push and pull of trying to manage life with his unmanageable gaming obsession. We were happy to see him off to college; we supposed he would outgrow his juvenile habit and finally start his life. But we were wrong. On that drive home, I realized we were dealing with something more serious than a bad habit. This had all the signs of an addiction.<\/p>\n<h3>Research<\/h3>\n<p>My background is in nursing, so I took a deep dive into the brain research related to video game use. I talked to physicians and neuroscientists across the country and learned that gaming addiction includes a well-defined neurochemical component. MRIs show gaming addiction to be neurologically similar to every other addiction. Like gambling and using drugs, gaming hijacks the dopamine reward pathway. The overproduction of dopamine during gaming sets off a series of neurochemical events, leading to a craving for more. This, in turn, leads to impaired self-control and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/questions-and-answers\/item\/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dysfunction<\/a> in daily activities and interpersonal relationships\u2014underlying factors in every addiction.<\/p>\n<p>Adam wasn\u2019t exaggerating: the game had \u201cdone something\u201d to his brain.<\/p>\n<p>I shifted from thinking in terms of parental limits\u2014like setting a curfew or not allowing R-rated movies\u2014to understanding the deeper emotional and spiritual implications of a child lost in the virtual world. Gaming wasn&#8217;t a neutral rite of passage. Instead, like all addictive activities, it could potentially sweep a child away from the foundation of his family and spiritual life. He becomes the god of his own universe in his daily escape. Over time, the virtual world can become so authentic and so immersive that the need for his family, for God, and for natural joy diminishes.<\/p>\n<h3>Redemption<\/h3>\n<p>Even when times were dark and I felt isolated in this struggle, I knew deep down there was a greater purpose. Second Corinthians 1:3\u20135 tells us God comforts us in all our troubles so we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we&#8217;ve received from God. I promised myself I&#8217;d never forget the pain of this time in my life so I could help other families prevent what happened to my oldest son.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Over time, the virtual world can become so authentic and so immersive that the need for his family, for God, and for natural joy diminishes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Fortunately, our story is filled with redemption. First, nearly 12 years later, Adam is doing well\u2014he served five years in the U.S. Army and graduated from college. Now finishing law school, he&#8217;s also a spokesperson for ScreenStrong, the nonprofit organization we started to save kids from the path he took. Adam tells them he wishes he could reclaim the more than 10,000 hours he spent gaming and losing himself in the virtual world.<\/p>\n<p>Second, because of what Adam experienced, my husband and I changed how we addressed technology with his sister and his younger twin brothers, creating for them a childhood free from video games and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/podcasts\/tgc-podcast\/christian-parents-ever-give-kids-smartphone\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smartphones<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Radical? Yes. But our daughter thrived during high school without a smartphone or social media. She was never pulled into the drama of middle school text wars or the temptations older teens faced on social media. The twins are flourishing in high school, investing in face-to-face relationships with many groups of friends, coaches, and teachers. Instead of playing <i>Fortnite<\/i> for four hours daily, they compete in baseball and cross country, serve on the student council, and enjoy playing violin and piano. All these are activities Adam missed out on because of the time he&#8217;d invested staring at a screen, holding a game controller.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m often asked if they feel left out. No, my teens have close connections to their friends and our family. This path has led to so much joy in our home.<\/p>\n<p>Third, God has used Adam\u2019s story to reach many families. I now spend my time helping other moms and dads who are struggling with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/kids-off-screens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">screen-time problems<\/a> in their homes. Education about the effects of screens on brains becomes the light that shines in the dark places. Parents are able to understand the effects of screen overuse on the developing child and make the best decisions for their family. And through community, parents no longer feel isolation and shame. The result? Relationships are being restored.<\/p>\n<h3>Moving Forward<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no shame in making mistakes; we certainly made many. As parents, we struggle to live in the tension between God\u2019s sovereignty over every square inch of creation (to quote <a href=\"https:\/\/reformationaldl.files.wordpress.com\/2019\/07\/spheresovereignty_english.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abraham Kuyper<\/a>) and our responsibility to be faithful stewards of our lives and guardians of our children.<\/p>\n<p>How can we do this well? The addictive and provocative elements of video games are so powerful that I think it\u2019s dangerous to allow them into our homes as a valued activity during childhood and then expect our children to thrive. Setting our children up for failure isn&#8217;t protecting them; it&#8217;s not wise, and it doesn&#8217;t honor our Creator.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Education about the effects of screens on brains becomes the light that shines in the dark places.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Our parental responsibility is to guard our children against addictive elements of culture that harm them. Ask yourself some questions: Is game use in your home increasing over time? Is game time displacing sports and healthy hobbies? Are your child\u2019s grades and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/reclaiming-friendship-social-media-age\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relationships<\/a> suffering? Is his gaming distancing him from God and his family?<\/p>\n<p>If you sense something\u2019s wrong with your child\u2019s relationship with screens, don\u2019t ignore that persistent inner warning\u2014as I did for so long.<\/p>\n<p>Adam once told me, \u201cMom, you will never hurt my feelings if you share my story. Please warn as many families as you can.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Every family is facing the tidal wave of digital technology in childhood, but not every family has to be swept away by it. We can\u2019t inoculate our teens with parental controls or more conversations. We can\u2019t change the child development process: they&#8217;re intelligent but not mature. We can\u2019t force children to be \u201cwise\u201d with screen time, as they aren&#8217;t adults with a fully connected frontal cortex.<\/p>\n<p>But we can be more informed and diligent as we <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/reviews\/habits-household\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">align our kids\u2019 activities with our values<\/a>. We can proactively avoid screen struggles and focus on healthy relationships. The solution isn&#8217;t about taking away our kids\u2019 fun but giving back their deeper joy in real-life engagement. God created a world for them to explore and adventures for them to have in real life. Let\u2019s point them in his direction.<\/p>\n<p>And let\u2019s keep our own eyes focused there too. Remember that God is the One who gives us new mercies every morning (Lam. 3:22\u201323), wisdom when we ask (James 1:5), and endurance and encouragement we can share with others (Rom. 15:5).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaming addiction is real; don&#8217;t be afraid to search for help from parents who have come out on the other side of their screen struggles. There is hope. By the grace of God, you can reclaim your kids and reconnect your family.<\/p>\n",

As a new podcast series <em><a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-witch-trials-of-j-k-rowling\/id1671691064\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Witch Trials of J. K. Rowling<\/a><\/em> suggests in its very title, <a href=\"https:\/\/theweek.com\/feature\/1020838\/jk-rowlings-transphobia-controversy-a-complete-timeline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the criticism she now faces<\/a> for dissenting from the most fringe wings of transgender activism has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/06\/10\/873472683\/harry-potters-magic-fades-when-his-creator-tweets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reached a censorious fervor<\/a>. Narrated by former Westboro Baptist Church member Megan Phelps-Roper, the series is an intelligently constructed reflection on the power of ideology; the danger of myopic, totalitarian thinking; and the peculiar challenges facing free speech among the emerging adult generation. The well-executed podcast elicits both sympathy for Rowling and sobering bewilderment at the social revolutions of our age.<\/p>\n<p>But like many stories about Rowling\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/casualty-war-ideology-jk-rowling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">showdown with transgender activists<\/a>, <em>Witch Trials<\/em> misses something important: the digital polarization game was one that Rowling played and was winning\u2014until she wasn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Rowling, more so than almost any other author, leveraged the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/blogs\/trevin-wax\/expressive-individualism-series\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expressive individualism<\/a> intrinsic to the social media age to craft, and sell, a narrative about herself and her stories. In an age in which activists will cancel and decry pop culture artifacts for being insufficiently political, Rowling\u2019s history illustrates the danger of pandering to this phenomenon and the way both art and political discourse suffer accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>Rowling\u2019s Story<\/h3>\n<p>Much of the power of the <em>Witch Trials<\/em> podcast comes from the way it features Rowling herself. Her interview with Phelps-Roper shapes the entire series; Rowling\u2019s traumatic and inspiring life story, her account of the unexpected success of the series, and her perspective as a progressive feminist are established early. \u201cI know what it is to be a vulnerable woman,\u201d Rowling says, explaining how her suffering at the hands of an abusive husband, and the poverty and desperation she and her children experienced once they got away, shaped her worldview.<\/p>\n<p>Rowling\u2019s story is as famous as it is inspiring. Pinching pennies as a single mother, Rowling endured several publishers<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u2019 <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">rejections before finally getting her manuscript for <\/span><i style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone<\/i><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> (changed to \u201cSorcerer\u2019s Stone\u201d in the U.S. version) accepted. The rest is, literally, history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Though the Potter stories aren&#8217;t political allegories, themes from Rowling\u2019s personal life are evident: neglect and mistreatment at home (the Dursleys), the saving power of friendship (Hogwarts), and the necessity of doing what\u2019s right even when it&#8217;s difficult (confronting Voldemort). It\u2019s this last theme that Rowling and Phelps-Roper tie to the controversies over gender identity.<\/p>\n<p>The podcast retraces the vitriolic criticism Rowling endured for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jk_rowling\/status\/1269389298664701952\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publicly tweeting<\/a> her support of policies that restrict transgendered women (biological men) from being admitted into women\u2019s shelters. For Rowling, this stance\u2014not against transgender ideology itself (she&#8217;s careful to say) but against the elimination of public distinctions between biological men and women\u2014is her own personal Potter-confronts-Voldemort moment.<\/p>\n<p>At multiple points, Phelps-Roper reads tweets or plays YouTube audio clips from Rowling\u2019s critics. The content is genuinely shocking: as hysterical as it is hateful, a dizzying collage of logical fallacy and violent threats. The podcast absolutely doesn&#8217;t shy away from portraying the transgender rights movement, particularly online, as extremist.<\/p>\n<p>Rowling, for her part, insists she&#8217;s always been open-minded politically. She compares Voldemort to a political dictator and casts sharp criticism on anyone who wants to shut down debate. In episode 2, Rowling says,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">A sense of righteousness is not incompatible with doing terrible things. You know, most of the people in movements that we consider hugely abhorrent, . . . many, many, many of the people involved in those movements understood themselves to be on the side of righteousness, believed they were doing the right thing, felt themselves justified in what they were doing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I suppose for me, book burners, by definition (predictably), to me, have placed themselves across a line, across a line of rational debate. \u201cI\u2019m simply going to destroy the idea that I don\u2019t like. I can\u2019t destroy it, so I\u2019ll destroy its representation. I will burn this book.\u201d There is no book on this planet that I would burn. No book, including books that I do think are damaging. Burning to me is the last result of people who cannot argue.<\/p>\n<p>Two things can be true at once: Rowling can be exactly right that suppressing speech instead of debating it is harmful to a free society, and yet it can also be the case that Rowling is rewriting her own story here. As <em>Witch Trials<\/em> makes a compelling case that the internet has helped erode the free exchange of ideas, it neglects to observe how Rowling herself often played into this dynamic.<\/p>\n<h3>Double-Edged Sword of Social Internet<\/h3>\n<p>Starting around the time of the publication of <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<\/i>, Rowling leaned into rising political polarization and online fan culture to stoke in her supporters the very same tribalistic impulses she now fends off.<\/p>\n<p>It was Rowling who <a href=\"https:\/\/techland.time.com\/2007\/10\/22\/dumbledore_gay\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">declared<\/a> (in a Q and A session in New York) that Dumbledore was gay. This revelation thrilled many, but it represented a cynically opportunist posture toward her own work. <i>Time<\/i> magazine&#8217;s Lev Grossman blogged gratefully about the announcement, but added, \u201cIf she really wanted Dumbledore to be gay . . . why didn\u2019t she just write him that way?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, Dumbledore\u2019s sexual orientation was announced <i>ex cathedra<\/i>; the books themselves don&#8217;t say a word about it. Was Rowling being genuine, or was she trying to score a political point with no threat of commercial risk to her already finished anthology?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>As <em>Witch Trials<\/em>\u00a0makes a compelling case that the internet has helped erode free exchange of ideas, it neglects to observe how Rowling herself often played into this dynamic.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is hardly the only example. Rowling, arguably more than any other famous novelist, has used social media to shape her public political image. She has called Donald Trump \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2015\/12\/08\/politics\/jk-rowling-donald-trump-voldemort\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">worse than Voldemort<\/a>,\u201d compared supporters of Scottish independence <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/general-news\/jk-rowling-calls-scottish-independence-711062\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to the murderous Death Eaters<\/a>, and referenced her own characters to defend politically leftist views. While Rowling\u2019s interview on the podcast suggests someone who strives for good-faith argument and open-mindedness, her track record is that of someone who&#8217;s been every bit as ideological as her critics.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this? Fascinatingly, episode 3 of <em>Witch Trials<\/em> focuses on the role the internet has played, not just in the transgender movement but also in the Harry Potter fan world. Phelps-Roper painstakingly charts the growth of the online fandom and observes that the generation raised most passionately on the stories was also one of the first generations raised with the web. Not only did this create a strong network effect among Potter fans, but it led to Rowling\u2019s personal involvement in many of these online spaces.<\/p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s where the gender revolution and Rowling\u2019s own story intersect. The social internet is what allowed Rowling to cast herself and her stories as progressive totems, and the social internet is what cultivated and weaponized transgender ideology. Digital technology\u2019s power to polarize us is intrinsic to its nature. Through its disembodying effect, and by giving us the power to curate and control our experience of the world, this technology offers the illusion of total self-creation.<\/p>\n<p>What Rowling\u2019s story shows is that this power is a double-edged sword. When the \u201cself\u201d we create finds favor with the audience we\u2019re trying to reach, it serves us well. But when our projected self is out of step with that same audience, the power of the social internet turns decidedly against us. Live by the social media sword, die by the social media sword.<\/p>\n<h3>Tools We Use Use Us<\/h3>\n<p>In his book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business\/dp\/014303653X\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Amusing Ourselves to Death<\/i><\/a>, Neil Postman wrote that television not only gave audiences a staged view of the world but that, by virtue of its nature, it suggested what the real world <i>ought<\/i> to look like. As TV \u201cre-staged\u201d the world, Postman argued, modern people started to expect their information, their conversations, and even their religion would more closely resemble the trappings of entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>As I write in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Digital-Liturgies-Rediscovering-Christian-Wisdom\/dp\/1433587130\/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my forthcoming book<\/a>, online technology similarly \u201cre-stages\u201d the world. With our hearts conditioned by the internet\u2019s capacities and values, we begin to expect that offline reality\u2014our politics, our relationships, even our very bodies\u2014becomes infinitely customizable. And when things don&#8217;t yield to our command, we respond to those realities the way we respond to something unwanted on the screen: trying to erase or mute that which challenges us.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Digital technology\u2019s power to polarize us is intrinsic to its nature.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Of course, what makes online technology so valuable is how it connects us to each other. This is what the young fans of the Potter series report in <em>Witch Trials<\/em>: the stories stirred something in them, and the internet helped them find others for whom these stories also resonated. And this is why Rowling, by her own testimony, started to go into these websites and community forums, both officially and anonymously. She was overwhelmed by seeing how her books had comforted and delighted so many.<\/p>\n<p>Yet we can see how both Rowling and her fans became sucked into a whirlpool of digital polarization. Rowling reinvented herself and reinterpreted her stories to play better and better with the emerging, progressive generation. Her fans appropriated these stories as parables for their own identity quests and political beliefs, with some eventually embracing the self-creation narrative of transgenderism.<\/p>\n<p>The story of J. K. Rowling\u2019s journey from hero to villain isn&#8217;t just a story about changing political winds. It\u2019s a story about expressive individualism, technology, and the inevitability of clashing personal narratives in a post-Christian world.<\/p>\n<p>Rowling\u2019s personal saga reminds Christians that the language of human rights <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/article\/everyone-you-know-believer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">becomes nonsensical when untethered from first principles<\/a>. Defending the vulnerable isn&#8217;t a magic pastime. It&#8217;s a virtue rooted in transcendent truth: the intrinsic value of all human beings created in the image of a holy Maker. Rowling\u2019s, and the West\u2019s, political progressivism isn&#8217;t enough to protect women and girls in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.9marks.org\/article\/youve-got-self-how-the-internet-cultivates-expressive-individualism-in-all-of-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digitally deconstructed society<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But it also reminds us that the tools we use may be using us. In our post-Christian age, screens do more than connect us. They <i>teach<\/i> us. Our reliance on disembodied technology to create the message or the movement we want is shaping that message and movement in ways we don\u2019t always understand.<\/p>\n<p>For J. K. Rowling, it\u2019s been a lesson more than a decade in the making.<\/p>\n",
